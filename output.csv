Text: Determining the willingness to link climate and trade policy. Analysts have long advocated a linkage between international cooperation on climate change and trade measures, such as border tariffs, as a means of enforcing agreements to achieve deeper cooperation. Nevertheless, it has remained difficult to evaluate whether policy makers will allow such linkages and whether linking climate and trade would, in reality, yield beneficial effects to international cooperation. Working with a large sample of climate experts who are highly experienced in climate diplomacy and policy, we elicited how they view the legitimacy and usefulness of linking trade and climate and what factors can explain those views. We find that experts from richer countries, especially Europe, are more likely to see linkage as legitimate and effective. These experts are particularly likely to favor universal border adjustments (UBAs) that apply to all countries to level the economic playing field, rather than trade measures that define an exclusive “club” of countries making extra efforts to cut emissions while punishing non-club members. This finding reveals tensions between a shift in academic thinking about the value of club-based strategies—including clubs that use border measures for enforcement—and what climate policy experts see as valuable. European experts are particularly likely to favor UBAs and they are also least likely to see risks in implementing trade measures. In general, countries with high quality national institutions see lower risks in using trade measures to enforce greater cooperation on climate change. A particularly robust finding is that experts who perceive their home country’s emissions reduction pledge as ambitious are more likely to see risks from using trade measures. While these are the countries that could benefit the most from using trade measures, they are also the countries that are offering the most under the existing Paris Agreement. Experts seem to be increasingly aware of the dissonance between the voluntarism of the Paris Agreement and growing political pressures to apply trade measures. We also find the attributes of experts, such as training and career experience, can affect their assessments. In some models, experts with economic or business backgrounds are more likely to favor trade measures while those with careers in natural science, diplomacy, and national government are less sanguine. Our results suggest that diverging views on the need for trade-based enforcement are robust, associated with important attributes of countries such as their commitments, and likely to persist—suggesting that policy strategies favoring the use of trade measures must pay close attention to the conditions that will determine where and how trade measures can be implemented. Experts from many countries that are the biggest supporters of the Paris approach to climate cooperation also doubt the legitimacy of trade measures.',

 Text: A social path to human-like artificial intelligence. Traditionally, cognitive and computer scientists have viewed intelligence solipsistically, as a property of unitary agents devoid of social context. Given the success of contemporary learning algorithms, we argue that the bottleneck in artificial intelligence (AI) advancement is shifting from data assimilation to novel data generation. We bring together evidence showing that natural intelligence emerges at multiple scales in networks of interacting agents via collective living, social relationships and major evolutionary transitions, which contribute to novel data generation through mechanisms such as population pressures, arms races, Machiavellian selection, social learning and cumulative culture. Many breakthroughs in AI exploit some of these processes, from multi-agent structures enabling algorithms to master complex games such as Capture-The-Flag and StarCraft II, to strategic communication in the game Diplomacy and the shaping of AI data streams by other AIs. Moving beyond a solipsistic view of agency to integrate these mechanisms could provide a path to human-like compounding innovation through ongoing novel data generation.',

Text: Health diplomacy in action: The cancer legacy of the Good Friday Agreement. 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which led peace in Northern Ireland. As well as its impact on peace and reconciliation, the Good Friday Agreement has also had a lasting positive impact on cancer research and cancer care across the island of Ireland. Pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the respective Departments of Health in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), giving rise to the Ireland – Northern Ireland – National Cancer Institute Cancer Consortium, an unparalleled tripartite agreement designed to nurture and develop linkages between cancer researchers, physicians and allied healthcare professionals across Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US, delivering world class research and better care for cancer patients on the island of Ireland and driving research and innovation in the US.',

Text: Expanding ocean protection and peace: A window for science diplomacy in the Gulf. The ecological state of the Persian or Arabian Gulf (hereafter 'Gulf') is in sharp decline. Calls for comprehensive ecosystem-based management approaches and transboundary conservation have gone largely unanswered, despite mounting marine threats made worse by climate change. The region's long-standing political tensions add additional complexity, especially now as some Gulf countries will soon adopt ambitious goals to protect their marine environments as part of new global environmental commitments. The recent interest in global commitments comes at a time when diplomatic relations among all Gulf countries are improving. There is a window of opportunity for Gulf countries to meet global marine biodiversity conservation commitments, but only if scientists engage in peer-to-peer diplomacy to build trust, share knowledge and strategize marine conservation options across boundaries. The Gulf region needs more ocean diplomacy and coordination; just as critically, it needs actors at its science-policy interface to find better ways of adapting cooperative models to fit its unique marine environment, political context and culture. We propose a practical agenda for scientist-led diplomacy in the short term and lines of research from which to draw (e.g. co-production, knowledge exchange) to better design future science diplomacy practices and processes suited to the Gulf's setting.",

Text: Wild polar bear conservation: A case of successful arctic science diplomacy?. As poster child for the climate crisis and symbol of the circumpolar North, the polar bear has received considerable public and scholarly attention in recent years. A review of academic research on polar bear politics shows that many texts share a positive frame of polar bear conservation as a successful example of Arctic science diplomacy. Despite making such substantive claims, authors fail by and large to explain their reasoning or provide evidence of this success, aside from references to the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears. This article hence evaluates the claim that polar bear conservation constitutes a successful case of Arctic science diplomacy. To do so, the paper establishes a set of success criteria for Arctic science diplomacy. Based on an analysis of policy, governmental, and scientific documents and interviews on polar bear management and conservation, the paper identifies two periods of polar bear science diplomacy, evaluating each based on the success criteria developed in this paper. The first period (1960–90s) is defined by traditional threats to polar bears that are addressed through successful Arctic science diplomacy. Though the second period (1990s-present) also features elements of successful science diplomacy, Arctic scientists and diplomats are unable to effectively address the now dominant threat of climate change, shifting authority away from the Arctic and towards the international realm of climate change research and politics. As the climate crisis continues to outrank and amplify traditional threats to ecosystems around the globe, the article argues that this shift in epistemic and diplomatic authority may be indicative of a fate awaiting other specialized science diplomacy communities worldwide.',

Text: Evaluating normative capacity through Arctic environmental governance. International cooperation in the Arctic is largely operationalised through environmental governance in a constellation of institutions that promote scientific knowledge of the Arctic region. While the Arctic Council is placed at the centre of this network for environmental protection and resource management across the region, other institutions play critical roles in facilitating scientific knowledge production that promotes the security and development of the region and its resources across national boundaries. Evaluating the role of environmental protection in Arctic governance within models of science diplomacy, this paper argues that the assumption of environmental responsibility should act as a normative operator for Arctic environmental governance, shaping the relations between actors in this regional network and legitimising decision-making by Arctic states as they socially construct the mechanisms and regional exceptionalism of Arctic governance. However, environmental responsibility falls short of acting as a normative operator for environmental protection that also prevents the impact of climate change on the Arctic environment, excluding its function as an overarching normative operator for the international system, reducing state legitimacy for regional decision-making in extra-territorial spaces.',

Text: Global Neurosurgery: Progress and Resolutions at the 75th World Health Assembly. Neurosurgical advocates for global surgery/neurosurgery at the 75th World Health Assembly gathered in person for the first time after the COVID-19 pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland, in May 2022. This article reviews the significant progress in the global health landscape targeting neglected neurosurgical patients, emphasizing high-level policy advocacy and international efforts to support a new World Health Assembly resolution in mandatory folic acid fortification to prevent neural tube defects. The process of developing global resolutions through the World Health Organization and its member states is summarized. Two new global initiatives focused on the surgical patients among the most vulnerable member states are discussed, the Global Surgery Foundation and the Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and other Neurological Disorders. Progress toward a neurosurgery-inspired resolution on mandatory folic acid fortification to prevent spina bifida-folate is described. In addition, priorities for moving the global health agenda forward for the neurosurgical patient as it relates to the global burden of neurological disease are reviewed after the COVID-19 pandemic.',

Text: Building parliamentary capacities for advancing the disaster risk reduction agenda: Notes and reflections from a capacity-building field training for parliamentarians of the Americas and the Caribbean. As the escalating impacts of climate change exert greater pressure on national governments and their constituents, particularly in marginalized communities, legislators will need to leverage their roles to support national and local efforts to build disaster resilience. This will require a better understanding of risk, but also of the interconnections between the climate and disaster agendas. This is vital for legislators to strategically apply their capabilities to achieving the targets outlined by their respective national governments. The role of individual national parliamentarians in advancing the priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction remains largely unexplored in scholarly research. However, these individuals play pivotal social and political roles with varying degrees of power, networks, and local influence. Such roles can enhance communities' capacity to participate in building disaster resilience. A significant hurdle for parliamentarians is comprehending the priorities and mechanisms necessary to develop a robust and coherent disaster risk management system. This involves navigating the intricate conceptual dimensions of the disaster risk reduction agenda and bridging these concepts with their everyday functions as parliamentarians. We contend that field briefings and co-production offer an effective platform for enhancing parliamentarians' capacity to grasp the concepts surrounding climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. This article presents reflections drawn from a parliamentary training on climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction with insights from the three-day capacity-building workshop with national legislators from the Americas and the Caribbean. The project was done in partnership between the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and an inter-parliamentary organization.",

Text: WHEN ACADEMIC DISPLACEMENT AND INTERNATIONALIZATION INTERSECT, DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR INCLUSION IN HIGHER EDUCATION: CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE WELCOMING PROGRAM FOR UKRAINIAN SCIENTISTS, PARANÁ – BRAZIL. Universities have a unique role in facilitating the integration of displaced scientists into the academic community, thus promoting inclusion. Concurrently, institutions of higher education worldwide are increasingly emphasizing internationalization, aiming to attract and support a diverse faculty and student body. This paper aims to discuss how initiatives focused on integrating displaced scientists into Brazilian higher education relate to institutional internationalization efforts. We examine the Welcoming Program for Ukrainian Scientists, Paraná, Brazil. By combining literature/document analysis and interviews with key actors, we examine the initial motivation for universities and participants and the externalities resulting from implementation to provide some insights. The study reveals that the program has the potential to make a significant contribution to the internationalization and diversity in higher education and, concurrently, address social justice concerns.',

Text: International interdisciplinary Arctic research: Case study of the Russian Arctic biomonitoring mega-grant project. The Arctic region is commonly seen as a territory of international dialogue and cooperation. This perception is largely due to the science diplomacy efforts that are largely being contributed by universities, scientific centres, research teams and individual scholars. This paper discusses the Arctic science diplomacy initiatives proposed by Russia's northernmost federal university. Of particular interest is the case of establishing in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation of national biological monitoring network - the initiative supported by the government-funded mega-grant programme. Our analysis suggests that two pillars of science diplomacy - science for diplomacy and diplomacy for science - can be successfully combined within the framework of one project. Evidence is provided of the pursuit of national interests being not a limiting factor but rather a driver in the process of promoting diplomatic collaborations in science, serving as a third science diplomacy pillar. Significant progress towards ensuring peace and harmony in the Arctic and sustaining international dialogue on science-based responses to global challenges has been achieved through science diplomacy initiatives proposed by Northern (Arctic) Federal University (NArFU). The authors confirm that most effective tools for establishing good neighbourly relations in the Arctic and promoting international cooperation are offered by scientific discussion.",
