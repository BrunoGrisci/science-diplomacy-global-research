Nevertheless, it has remained difficult to evaluate whether policy makers will allow such linkages and whether linking climate and trade would, in reality, yield beneficial effects to international cooperation. Working with a large sample of climate experts who are highly experienced in climate diplomacy and policy, we elicited how they view the legitimacy and usefulness of linking trade and climate and what factors can explain those views. We find that experts from richer countries, especially Europe, are more likely to see linkage as legitimate and effective. These experts are particularly likely to favor universal border adjustments (UBAs) that apply to all countries to level the economic playing field, rather than trade measures that define an exclusive “club” of countries making extra efforts to cut emissions while punishing non-club members. This finding reveals tensions between a shift in academic thinking about the value of club-based strategies—including clubs that use border measures for enforcement—and what climate policy experts see as valuable. European experts are particularly likely to favor UBAs and they are also least likely to see risks in implementing trade measures. In general, countries with high quality national institutions see lower risks in using trade measures to enforce greater cooperation on climate change. A particularly robust finding is that experts who perceive their home country’s emissions reduction pledge as ambitious are more likely to see risks from using trade measures. While these are the countries that could benefit the most from using trade measures, they are also the countries that are offering the most under the existing Paris Agreement. Experts seem to be increasingly aware of the dissonance between the voluntarism of the Paris Agreement and growing political pressures to apply trade measures. We also find the attributes of experts, such as training and career experience, can affect their assessments. In some models, experts with economic or business backgrounds are more likely to favor trade measures while those with careers in natural science, diplomacy, and national government are less sanguine. Our results suggest that diverging views on the need for trade-based enforcement are robust, associated with important attributes of countries such as their commitments, and likely to persist—suggesting that policy strategies favoring the use of trade measures must pay close attention to the conditions that will determine where and how trade measures can be implemented.

This article hence evaluates the claim that polar bear conservation constitutes a successful case of Arctic science diplomacy. To do so, the paper establishes a set of success criteria for Arctic science diplomacy. Based on an analysis of policy, governmental, and scientific documents and interviews on polar bear management and conservation, the paper identifies two periods of polar bear science diplomacy, evaluating each based on the success criteria developed in this paper. The first period (1960–90s) is defined by traditional threats to polar bears that are addressed through successful Arctic science diplomacy. Though the second period (1990s-present) also features elements of successful science diplomacy, Arctic scientists and diplomats are unable to effectively address the now dominant threat of climate change, shifting authority away from the Arctic and towards the international realm of climate change research and politics. As the climate crisis continues to outrank and amplify traditional threats to ecosystems around the globe, the article argues that this shift in epistemic and diplomatic authority may be indicative of a fate awaiting other specialized science diplomacy communities worldwide.",Arctic | Marine mammal | Polar bear | Science diplomacy | Ursus maritimus,0,0,,,,undefined,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n- States: None mentioned\n- Continents: Arctic\n- Regions: Circumpolar North', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]] llm_output={'token_usage': {'total_tokens': 345, 'prompt_tokens': 325, 'completion_tokens': 20}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'} run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('e68b2dc8-203a-47ad-8d1f-ab8957056e98'))]","generations=[[Generation(text='\n\nYes', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]] llm_output={'token_usage': {'total_tokens': 320, 'prompt_tokens': 318, 'completion_tokens': 2}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'} run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('2157f6bc-caf1-4329-89db-c5599037359e'))]",Yes,"- States: None mentioned

The monitoring system aims to uncover, cluster, and classify temporal patterns of escalation to improve future forecasts and better understand the causes of escalation toward war. It identifies important temporal patterns in conflict data using novel pattern detection methods and new data. These patterns are used to forecast conflict, with live predictions released in real time. Finally, the discovery of recurring motifs—prototypes—can inform new or existing theoretical frameworks.

The monitoring system aims to uncover, cluster, and classify temporal patterns of escalation to improve future forecasts and better understand the causes of escalation toward war. It identifies important temporal patterns in conflict data using novel pattern detection methods and new data. These patterns are used to forecast conflict, with live predictions released in real time. Finally, the discovery of recurring motifs—prototypes—can inform new or existing theoretical frameworks. In this article, I discuss the methodological innovations required to achieve these goals and the path to creating an autonomous conflict monitoring system.

Arctic practical discourse","Arctic science diplomacy in new geopolitical conditions: From “soft” power to “hard” dialogue?Recent years have shown that international science dialogue exists at the edge of turbulence and is disturbed by different geopolitical events. The notion of science diplomacy has taken the critical discourse to different levels of actors. Such a discourse exposes the epistemological ambivalence and methodological imbalance of both science and diplomacy in this phenomenon. Current geopolitical conditions have revealed new edges of science diplomacy instruments that spread from soft to hard practices. Different levels of dialogue and cooperation have shown different examples of resilience and adaptability (or the opposite) to the external turbulence. The phenomenon of regionalisation in science diplomacy is facing criticism from the science community while the current geopolitical situation has dramatically influenced the Arctic science dialogue, as well as governance practices.

One approach that considers both of these aspects is cross-sector coalition building; from schools, universities, and other practitioners, to industry partners, government entities, and community organizations. International partnerships can further deepen knowledge derived from these coalitions, providing a broader context that enables coalitions to better support education pathways. In this panel discussion, computing education experts from the United States, Thailand, and Botswana will discuss current computing education e?orts in their country and how they are leveraging international partners to build coalitions and create equitable computing education pathways. They will highlight strategies unique to the particular context of their nations, while also discussing shared challenges and opportunities that can be addressed through international cooperation in education research. The overarching goals are 1) to engage the audience in a conversation about how researchers and practitioners can leverage and create global networks in their own work to create equitable opportunities in computing education and 2) to share resources and examples of how international perspectives can provide new insights into computing education research. The session format will be a combination of moderated panel discussion and audience interaction. The timeline of the session is as follows: • The Panel Moderator will poll the audience in the room and online to determine the representation of countries in attendance.

This paper aims to present an overview of science diplomacy in medical physics, from an international perspective, illustrating the ways collaborations within and across continents can lead to scientific and professional achievements that advance scientific growth and improve patients care. Methods: Science diplomacy actions were sought that promote collaborations in medical physics across the continents, related to professional and scientific aspects alike. Results: Several science diplomacy actions have been identified to promote education and training, to facilitate research and development, to effectively communicate science to the public, to enable equitable access of patients to healthcare and to focus on gender equity within the profession as well as healthcare provision. Scientific and professional organizations in the field of medical physics across all continents have adopted a number of efforts in their aims, many of them with great success, to promote science diplomacy and to foster international collaborations.

This paper aims to present an overview of science diplomacy in medical physics, from an international perspective, illustrating the ways collaborations within and across continents can lead to scientific and professional achievements that advance scientific growth and improve patients care. Methods: Science diplomacy actions were sought that promote collaborations in medical physics across the continents, related to professional and scientific aspects alike. Results: Several science diplomacy actions have been identified to promote education and training, to facilitate research and development, to effectively communicate science to the public, to enable equitable access of patients to healthcare and to focus on gender equity within the profession as well as healthcare provision. Scientific and professional organizations in the field of medical physics across all continents have adopted a number of efforts in their aims, many of them with great success, to promote science diplomacy and to foster international collaborations. Conclusions: Professionals in medical physics can advance through international cooperation, by building strong communication across scientific communities, addressing rising demands, exchange scientific information and knowledge.",yes,yes,None,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Status-quo","Rethinking African-European Scientific Cooperation: The Case of the Platform for African-European StudiesAfrican universities rely on teaching traditions and scientific theories based on Western epistemologies and ontologies. Interactions between European and African scholars too tend to focus on the deficits in African experiences, knowledge, research and teaching methodologies and the poor economic environments in which they operate that are characterized by inadequate infrastructure and budgets. This essay discusses an emerging opportunity in science diplomacy within African-European Union (EU) interactions in higher education and argues that a fundamental revision of the imbalances in African-European scholarly relationships is possible. The essay uses the case of the emerging Platform for African–European Studies, which involves 22 universities (including 14 in Africa and eight in Europe) and underscores the importance of science diplomacy, knowledge co-creation and co-production to correct hegemonic knowledge about Africa. It explores the origins of the programme, its attempt to follow a critical global and decolonized approach in addressing the revision of curricula both in Europe and in Africa and the co-design of research. It concludes by highlighting some of the obstacles to disrupting the status-quo.",yes,yes,Africa; European Union,None,None; European Union,None,None; None,,,#NAME?,None,None; None,,Africa; Europe,#NAME?,Africa; Europe,Africa; Europe,Africa; Europe

Universities, as engines of knowledge creation and dissemination and as incubators of disciplined yet original thinking, have a key role to play in tackling the most complex challenges that societies and our planet face, from infectious diseases to the climate emergency. This commentary presents the perspectives from Sunway University, a young private university in Malaysia that made a strong commitment to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) prior to the pandemic, and its experiences in promoting research, innovation, and learning as part of COVID-19 recovery and in preparation for future crises such as the climate emergency. Some of the university’s initiatives include embracing the planetary health approach, reviving essential public health functions, exploring pandemic resilience, addressing ‘infodemics’ and promoting science diplomacy. The example of Sunway University provides some insights on the opportunities and challenges that academic institutions face as they seek to reorient the paradigm of education, research, and service away from disciplinary siloes and towards a more integrated, preventive, accessible and translational approach.",yes,yes,Malaysia,Malaysia,Malaysia,None,None,South-eastern Asia,,#NAME?,South-eastern Asia,South-eastern Asia,Asia,,#NAME?,Asia,Asia,Asia

This article provides analysis based on the triangulation of qualitative data gathered via document analysis and in-depth semi-structured expert interviews to gain insight into the involvement of the actors responsible for the negotiations that led to the Artemis Accords and their diplomatic communication style. The results identified different uses of public and private diplomatic communication for advancing norms of behaviour and transparency. Negotiators used public diplomatic communication in order to influence foreign governments on the need for norms of behaviour and transparency to further peaceful space exploration beyond low Earth orbit.

Acknowledging the latter’s importance, most countries make it part of their internationalization policies. With development demands to further science capacities, and global problems becoming more complex, the science–foreign policy nexus has deepened in its conceptual and practical approaches, giving rise to the evolving concept and prominence of science diplomacy. Though science has been “used for years for international relations purposes around the world, science diplomacy has become a new term for an old concept”, today it is a key tool to promote closer relations between nations, define common global goals, and as support to the internationalization of science and foreign policies. With the COVID-19 crisis, science diplomacy has gained renewed importance and calls for new approaches like the further development of “science of science diplomacy” or the inclusion of new policy support tools such as foresight.

Yet underlying some of these well-intended and sometimes successful initiatives is a one-sided understanding of SD. The most recent literature takes a more differentiated approach towards the means and ends of SD. It shows that international scientific interaction is shaped by the twofold logic of competition and collaboration. Instruments of SD can be meant to serve national interests, collective regional goals or global agendas.

Arctic politics","Between global collaboration and national competition: Unraveling the many faces of Arctic science diplomacyIt has been argued that science diplomacy (SD) helps avoid or mitigate conflicts among stakeholders in the Arctic. Yet underlying some of these well-intended and sometimes successful initiatives is a one-sided understanding of SD. The most recent literature takes a more differentiated approach towards the means and ends of SD. It shows that international scientific interaction is shaped by the twofold logic of competition and collaboration. Instruments of SD can be meant to serve national interests, collective regional goals or global agendas. The present paper disentangles these confounding discourses of collaboration and competition based on a conceptually enhanced SD framework. It analyses Arctic strategies and two cases of Arctic SD, the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation and research activities on Svalbard, to reveal the mechanisms of collaboration and competition in the sphere of international science in relation to security, environment and economy.

Local government participates in national science diplomacy in four primary ways: twinned cities, intercity international organizations, foreign direct exchanges between cities, and city collaboration platforms. The representative event of polar science diplomacy was the conclusion of the Antarctic Treaty by 12 participating countries, which included the United States of America and the Soviet Union, during the International Geophysical Year. Subsequently, starting from nothing, China has achieved historic advances in its polar activities on small–large through polar science diplomacy. Shanghai is a gateway city via which China communicates with the Arctic and Antarctic, and it has been promoting China’s polar science diplomacy since the 1980s. The status of Shanghai as a national polar gateway city developed during the 1980s–1990s, and its foreign direct exchanges comprised mainly personnel visits.

Local government participates in national science diplomacy in four primary ways: twinned cities, intercity international organizations, foreign direct exchanges between cities, and city collaboration platforms. The representative event of polar science diplomacy was the conclusion of the Antarctic Treaty by 12 participating countries, which included the United States of America and the Soviet Union, during the International Geophysical Year. Subsequently, starting from nothing, China has achieved historic advances in its polar activities on small–large through polar science diplomacy. Shanghai is a gateway city via which China communicates with the Arctic and Antarctic, and it has been promoting China’s polar science diplomacy since the 1980s. The status of Shanghai as a national polar gateway city developed during the 1980s–1990s, and its foreign direct exchanges comprised mainly personnel visits. Since the beginning of 21st century, Shanghai has become an Asian polar gateway city and the forms of foreign direct exchanges have become increasingly diverse. During this transformative process, Shanghai experienced problems concerning the lack of top-level design, single form of participation and low level of foreign direct exchanges.

Not even diplomacy could escape change when Covid-19 hit the world in January 2020. Old approaches that have been in place for decades, even centuries, changed drastically, and diplomacy could not expect to continue as if nothing had happened. Approach to and application and operation of diplomacy has essentially been affected. In the era after Covid-19, countries and diplomats will still have to pay attention to these variables and will hardly be able to return to a previous era. Furthermore, domestic politics play an important role when considering strategic foreign policy decisions due to the threats that are expected or are already being carried out in connection with national security issues. Decisions on foreign affairs must therefore be evaluated in a certain domestic context because they develop mainly within national borders. In recent decades, the link between the two has become closer. The concepts of national interest, national security, domestic politics, and foreign policy have now become even more intertwined. Consequently, the question arises involuntarily: how are diplomats prepared and trained for this new world. Nowadays, diplomats are expected to be international advisers. Geopolitical views and applications have become more and more important, and the world is more interconnected than ever before. Understanding the global system is an inevitable requirement. The era requires people who can make difficult decisions and who will not worry about fine protocol rules being strictly enforced and adhered to anymore. These international advisers are now more than ever involved and instrumental in decision-making processes of peace and national security. This interdisciplinary role that these advisers must play is a challenging one that requires skilful dynamics. Contemporary diplomacy is changing at an unprecedented pace and is characterised by new role players, new issues, and new responsibilities. Multilateralism, which was the key to diplomacy since World War II has only gained momentum in the last 30 years, and with Covid-19, the importance of multilateral diplomacy was reaffirmed. In the span of two years, Covid-19 has revealed itself as a great equaliser, proving how interdependent the whole world really is. Covid-19 has unequivocally proved that the future of diplomacy is multilaterally driven. In addition, Covid-19 prevents personal contact and meetings, but foreign policymakers have been forced to adapt to a new digital norm. That digital revolution not only makes a wealth of information available, but also increases the speed at which decisions must be made. Diplomats similarly benefit from gathering and sharing knowledge, and this knowledge is made available at an unprecedented rate and needs to be managed. Knowledge management is the efficient handling of information and resources within a particular organisation. Knowledge diplomacy and a knowledge management system are both important because they increase the effectiveness of an institution's decision-making ability and ensure that all employees have access to overall expertise within the organisation. Knowledge management is consequently the conscious process of defining, structuring, retaining, and sharing knowledge and experience of employees within an organisation. The term knowledge diplomacy is becoming more and more popular and is used in different ways. Knowledge diplomacy, therefore, understands the role that international higher education, research, and innovation can play in strengthening relations between states. The impact of technology on the practice of diplomacy in the time of Covid-19 also inevitably emphasised the growing importance of conducting diplomacy digitally. Diplomats need to take a proactive approach to digitisation and acquire the skills needed to further promote domestic diplomacy through digital platforms as an important new component of future public diplomacy. The fight against the emergence of digital disinformation must, due to the nature of the decidedly negative implications of fake news, also receive pertinent attention. The subject of cyber security is most important and may not be ignored. Science diplomacy has become increasingly important. Another important aspect that diplomats should actively consider is how corporations continue to grow in their ability to practise public diplomacy. States are no longer the only international role players in the ever-growing diplomatic scene. Therefore, in order not to run the risk of becoming an endangered activity - which may become increasingly irrelevant because of increasing technological advances - diplomatic representation in the digital age must be intensified in order to increase diplomatic engagement and become a critical tool in an era of complex interdependence and globalisation. The number of role players involved in foreign affairs and diplomacy in one way or another has increased tremendously in recent decades. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more the world changes, and the challenge for diplomats is to manage these changes. The role of China and Russia in following their own world vision is an aspect of growing importance and demands constant vigilance.","corporate diplomacy | Covid-19 | digital diplomacy | digital technology | domestic policies | foreign affairs | geopolitical relations | knowledge diplomacy | knowledge management | multilateral diplomacy, science diplomacy",0,0,,,,undefined,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

As International Cooperation in Outer Space Affairs is an esteemed principle well established in UN Space Treaties, Declarations and Resolutions, this paper will also assess the extent to which its 'Space 2030' Implementation Plan - via Partnerships, Tools and Resources - responds to international calls for more cross-sector cooperation, enabling common goals by ensuring contributions from emerging space nations, considering the different level of development and expertise of different nations and stakeholders. Global Diplomacy is increasingly important for Space-Ocean Governance and Portugal is indeed the single-European country holding the largest maritime Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - in the Atlantic. Space-Ocean Diplomacy has often been on the Agenda of Portuguese Foreign Policy as Space-Ocean Governance is progressively gaining importance both at EU/global level and to reinforce the importance of this global cause, Portugal co-organises the United Nations Conference on the Oceans with Kenya, hosting it in June 2022, in Lisbon. Nations cannot afford to miss the call of a 'Space-Ocean Interactive Cause' for the future of humanity. With the same ambition with which other nations give priority to the Moon or Mars exploration, it is also time (on Earth) to dive into the deep sea to further discover that still vast unknown 'Universe of Knowledge', to expand Space-Ocean Interactions and greatly benefit from its abundant richness. Also in line with its 'Portugal Space 2030 - A Research, Innovation and Growth Strategy for Portugal' (2018), and its (national)'Defence Strategy for Space 2020-2030' (2021) and its (regional)'Strategy of the Azores for Space' (2022), Portuguese governments have approved, and are gradually implementing, a series of legislation establishing the regime of access and exercise of space activities, also regulating some insurance and liability issues, in a commendable attempt to present Portugal as a space-nation commercially attractive as well as internationally competitive. Hence, this paper will also provide an overview of Portuguese space related policies and plans. The Sustainable Development Goals (SGD) are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future (for all) and the upcoming UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) and the UN Ocean Conference are also an opportunity to inspire the global development of Space-Ocean affairs, pledging: 'Blue Economy For A Green(er) Future' (for all).",Access to Space for All | Blue Economy | Green Future | International Space Law | SGD | Space and Sustainable Development | Space Diplomacy | Space-Ocean Interactions | Space2030,0,0,,,,undefined,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

Blue Economy For A Green(er) Future.","SPACE DIPLOMACY: BLUE ECONOMY FOR A GREEN FUTURERecalling the UN COPUOS decision to develop a 'Space 2030' Agenda, this paper will analyse documentation addressing its four overarching objectives structured around four pillars: Space Economy, Space Society, Space Accessibility and Space Diplomacy - which are complementary and mutually reinforcing. As International Cooperation in Outer Space Affairs is an esteemed principle well established in UN Space Treaties, Declarations and Resolutions, this paper will also assess the extent to which its 'Space 2030' Implementation Plan - via Partnerships, Tools and Resources - responds to international calls for more cross-sector cooperation, enabling common goals by ensuring contributions from emerging space nations, considering the different level of development and expertise of different nations and stakeholders. Global Diplomacy is increasingly important for Space-Ocean Governance and Portugal is indeed the single-European country holding the largest maritime Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - in the Atlantic. Space-Ocean Diplomacy has often been on the Agenda of Portuguese Foreign Policy as Space-Ocean Governance is progressively gaining importance both at EU/global level and to reinforce the importance of this global cause, Portugal co-organises the United Nations Conference on the Oceans with Kenya, hosting it in June 2022, in Lisbon. Nations cannot afford to miss the call of a 'Space-Ocean Interactive Cause' for the future of humanity. With the same ambition with which other nations give priority to the Moon or Mars exploration, it is also time (on Earth) to dive into the deep sea to further discover that still vast unknown 'Universe of Knowledge', to expand Space-Ocean Interactions and greatly benefit from its abundant richness. Also in line with its 'Portugal Space 2030 - A Research, Innovation and Growth Strategy for Portugal' (2018), and its (national)'Defence Strategy for Space 2020-2030' (2021) and its (regional)'Strategy of the Azores for Space' (2022), Portuguese governments have approved, and are gradually implementing, a series of legislation establishing the regime of access and exercise of space activities, also regulating some insurance and liability issues, in a commendable attempt to present Portugal as a space-nation commercially attractive as well as internationally competitive. Hence, this paper will also provide an overview of Portuguese space related policies and plans. The Sustainable Development Goals (SGD) are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future (for all) and the upcoming UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) and the UN Ocean Conference are also an opportunity to inspire the global development of Space-Ocean affairs, pledging: 'Blue Economy For A Green(er) Future' (for all).",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

The macro-level features intergovernmental and interstate cooperation, such as making international agreements on scientific and technical cooperation, while at the micro-level individual scholars or scientific groups are supported by diplomats in their relations with foreign partners. However, there are issues jeopardizing cooperation between diplomats and scientists, and in order to gain insight into the nature of these problems and suggest ways to rectify the situation and so alleviate the struggle of both sides, the authors have conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with representatives of Russian-speaking academia and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The scientists interviewed have reported legal issues, as well as a lack of consular and visa information, as factors negatively affecting their decision to go abroad for working purposes; the so-called research diaspora is poorly consolidated, subverting efforts to coordinate Russian-speaking researchers outside Russia. The diplomats expressed regret over the absence of formal definitions for such terms as ‘researcher’ and ‘research diaspora’ which effectively hinders the identification of those eligible for diplomatic and consular support within the ‘diplomacy for science’ framework. The support itself is provided unevenly across Russian diplomatic establishments abroad, being dependent on the staffing situation and the Ambassador’s as well as senior diplomats’ personal interest in the matter. At the same time, both scholars and diplomats indicated difficulties in communicating with each other, caused by among other reasons a sense of mutual distrust. Based on the empirical data collected and analyzed, the authors have formulated a number of recommendations for decision-makers to bolster the country’s science diplomacy effort. To enhance consular and visa support, it is suggested that travel for the purposes of scientific exchange be designated as an independent visa category and ‘Scientist IDs’ introduced (similarly to ‘Fan IDs’). To engage more with the research diaspora, it is advisable to define what categories of researchers comprise the said group and offer them eased rules of entry and naturalization.

The author proposes the concept of knowledge diplomacy and carefully examines its fundamental rationales, actors, principles, instruments, and strategies. This is the first book that compares the similarities and differences between knowledge diplomacy and related terms such as soft power, cultural diplomacy, science diplomacy and public diplomacy to capture the expanding role of international higher education and research in bilateral and multilateral relations. The analysis of initiatives from around the world helps to ground and illustrate the key features of a knowledge diplomacy approach. ""This book makes a highly original and important contribution to the study of knowledge diplomacy and soft power. It brings together the latest thinking and trends in the study of contemporary diplomacy and international higher education.

The author proposes the concept of knowledge diplomacy and carefully examines its fundamental rationales, actors, principles, instruments, and strategies. This is the first book that compares the similarities and differences between knowledge diplomacy and related terms such as soft power, cultural diplomacy, science diplomacy and public diplomacy to capture the expanding role of international higher education and research in bilateral and multilateral relations. The analysis of initiatives from around the world helps to ground and illustrate the key features of a knowledge diplomacy approach. ""This book makes a highly original and important contribution to the study of knowledge diplomacy and soft power. It brings together the latest thinking and trends in the study of contemporary diplomacy and international higher education.

There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and cooperation with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia. This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stakeholders and key forms of Russia’s ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the implementation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD. These platforms include both national platforms (the international forum “The Arctic: The Territory of Dialogue” and “The Arctic: Present and Future”) and the active use of international platforms (“Arctic Frontiers,” “Polar Circle,” and “Arctic Science Summit Week”) and organizations such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS).",Arctic | Arctic council | Arctic strategies | Foreign policy | Public diplomacy | Science diplomacy,2,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,RSF,22-28-01287,Russian Science Foundation,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

Association of Polar Early Career Scientists","RUSSIA’S ARCTIC SCIENCE DIPLOMACY: THEORY AND PRACTICEArctic science diplomacy (ASD) is both a relatively new topic and an acute issue in Russian academic and political circles. There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and cooperation with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia. This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stakeholders and key forms of Russia’s ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the implementation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD.

Forgotten People, Forgotten Diseases also Reports on the health and economic effects of the NTDs, and the challenges of measuring diseases that do not always kill, but adversely affect productivity, child development, pregnancy outcome, and economic development. Lays a roadmap for continued control of existing and newly identified NTDs and spotlights potential opportunities for reducing global poverty and repairing the world. Describes a global initiative to provide annual mass drug administration for more than one billion people affected by NTDs. Highlights the role of innovation and product development partnerships for new treatments and vaccines. Explains how science and vaccine diplomacy ensure that a new generation of biotechnologies reaches the worlds poorest people. Forgotten People, Forgotten Diseases remains an essential resource for anyone seeking insight into global advocacy coordination and mobilization of resources to combat NTDs and continues to tell the story of the worlds people who live in extreme poverty and what it means for them to live with these devastating diseases. Like Dr. Hotez, I have struggled with how to best get the word out about our need to address NTDs and their link to poverty. Now he has provided us all with a remarkable tool, a book for people without an extensive scientific or medical background.

Global public health","Science diplomacy: Revisiting a new health paradigm in manoeuvring the pandemicA silver lining of late has been the witnessing of the real-time results of diplomatic relations in various areas including science technology innovation and especially vaccine development. A global problem calls for a joint action by participating countries to pool their resources together and find a solution the benefits of which reach beyond several borders. A well grounded international relation among countries in these times of pandemic needs to be further strengthened not just for the development of more potent vaccines but also for cementing ties in the areas of biotechnological or scientific advancements. The history is witness to the fact that such efforts have also provided an opportunity to look closer and deeper into the strategies that have not worked optimally in the past. Such a critical look at the performances in the desired areas at international level almost always delivers a better focused pragmatic solution. Emerging from several rounds of cross-border discussions and deliberations, the diplomatic exercises have already begun to bear fruits. The comity of nations is a more coherent whole today the proof of which is evident enough on multiple fronts of global public health.",yes,yes,None,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Atmospheric background monitoring can reflect the long-term changes of atmospheric composition caused by human activities on a global or regional scale. Therefore, it plays a very important role in both socioeconomic development and scientific research. Since the 1950s, some observation stations abroad have carried out background observation of the main atmospheric components such as carbon dioxide, ozone and atmospheric heavy metals. Additionally, the Global Ozone Observing System (GO3OS) and the Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) were established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1957 and 1968 to fulfill long-term and continuous observation of the chemical constituents of reactive gases, greenhouse gases, aerosols and acid rain. In 1989, WMO integrated GO3OS and BAPMoN into the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW). WMO/GAW has achieved great accomplishments owing to its long-term, systematic and accurate observation of the physical and chemical characteristics of atmospheric composition. During the period of 1981 to 2007, China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has built six representative regional GAW (Global Atmosphere Watch) stations, i.e., Shangdianzi (117.12°E, 40.65°N, 293.3 m asl), Lin'an (119.75°E, 30.28°N, 138.6 m asl), Longfengshan (127.60°E, 44. 73°N, 331 m asl), Akedala (87.93°E, 47.10°N, 562 m asl), Shangri-La (99.73°E, 28.01°N, 3580 m asl), and Jinsha (114.2°E, 29.63°N, 750 m asl), following the construction criteria of the GAW regional background stations. In addition, in accordance with the requirements of GAW global background station site selection, the Chinese government and the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF) jointly invested and established a global GAW station in China, namely, the China GAW Baseline Observatory (CGAWBO), located at Mt. Waliguan (100.89°E, 36.28°N, 3816 m asl) in Qinghai Province in 1994. These seven global/regional GAW stations build the current operational network of atmospheric background observation stations in China. Thanks to their long-term continous and precise atmospheric composition monitoring data and special representations, the stations at Mt. Waliguan, Shangdianzi, Lin'an, and Longfengshan were selected as the National Field Scientific Observation and Research Stations by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China in 2005. It is well known that the long-time series and excellent data on meteorological and atmospheric composition obtained from these seven global/regional GAW stations have played an unique role in China's efforts on addressing climate change, climate change diplomacy and negotiation, air pollution control, and scientific research. With China's socioeconomic development stepping into the new era, however, the deficiencies of the current GAW stations have become increasingly significant. Major problems lie in the unbalanced and insufficient development of these stations, as well as in the lack of innovation and demonstration. In this article, the status and the achievements of these seven stations are reviewed and summarized for the first time, followed by the identification and analysis of major problems of development.

Atmospheric background monitoring can reflect the long-term changes of atmospheric composition caused by human activities on a global or regional scale. Therefore, it plays a very important role in both socioeconomic development and scientific research. Since the 1950s, some observation stations abroad have carried out background observation of the main atmospheric components such as carbon dioxide, ozone and atmospheric heavy metals. Additionally, the Global Ozone Observing System (GO3OS) and the Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) were established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1957 and 1968 to fulfill long-term and continuous observation of the chemical constituents of reactive gases, greenhouse gases, aerosols and acid rain. In 1989, WMO integrated GO3OS and BAPMoN into the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW). WMO/GAW has achieved great accomplishments owing to its long-term, systematic and accurate observation of the physical and chemical characteristics of atmospheric composition. During the period of 1981 to 2007, China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has built six representative regional GAW (Global Atmosphere Watch) stations, i.e., Shangdianzi (117.12°E, 40.65°N, 293.3 m asl), Lin'an (119.75°E, 30.28°N, 138.6 m asl), Longfengshan (127.60°E, 44. 73°N, 331 m asl), Akedala (87.93°E, 47.10°N, 562 m asl), Shangri-La (99.73°E, 28.01°N, 3580 m asl), and Jinsha (114.2°E, 29.63°N, 750 m asl), following the construction criteria of the GAW regional background stations. In addition, in accordance with the requirements of GAW global background station site selection, the Chinese government and the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF) jointly invested and established a global GAW station in China, namely, the China GAW Baseline Observatory (CGAWBO), located at Mt. Waliguan (100.89°E, 36.28°N, 3816 m asl) in Qinghai Province in 1994. These seven global/regional GAW stations build the current operational network of atmospheric background observation stations in China. Thanks to their long-term continous and precise atmospheric composition monitoring data and special representations, the stations at Mt. Waliguan, Shangdianzi, Lin'an, and Longfengshan were selected as the National Field Scientific Observation and Research Stations by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China in 2005. It is well known that the long-time series and excellent data on meteorological and atmospheric composition obtained from these seven global/regional GAW stations have played an unique role in China's efforts on addressing climate change, climate change diplomacy and negotiation, air pollution control, and scientific research. With China's socioeconomic development stepping into the new era, however, the deficiencies of the current GAW stations have become increasingly significant. Major problems lie in the unbalanced and insufficient development of these stations, as well as in the lack of innovation and demonstration. In this article, the status and the achievements of these seven stations are reviewed and summarized for the first time, followed by the identification and analysis of major problems of development. At last, it is recommended that future endeavors should be concentrated on enhancing the comprehensive observation capability and international cooperation, as well as further improving the construction and capacities of the national field scientific research stations. Besides, it is also suggested that the development of atmospheric background station shall serve China's national and local development strategy, as well as strengthen its role in China's progress of ecological civilization.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Kingdon’s multiple streams framework is employed to explain how the interplay between policy actors, the policy agenda, policy problems, and policy alternatives leads to the creation of science diplomacy policies. Across the cases, all of the current science diplomacy discourses were applicable, holding stronger explanatory power in the problem and policy streams of the policy process while not obviously matching processes seen in the political stream. The findings also identified a gap in the current framing in understanding how geopolitical dynamics impact the creation of science diplomacy policies and how different policy actors negotiate, exploit, or are subject to these forces. By stabilizing one element of the ongoing debates around science diplomacy, the paper contributes a deeper examination of the array of policy actors and their involvement in different stages of the policy process leading to the formation of scientific cooperation agreements as tools of science diplomacy.",yes,yes,Canada; India; Norway; United Kingdom,Canada; India; Norway; United Kingdom,Canada; India; Norway; United Kingdom,None; None; None; None,None; None; None; None,Northern America; Southern Asia; Northern Europe,,#NAME?,Northern America; Southern Asia; Northern Europe,Northern America; Southern Asia; Northern Europe; Northern Europe,Americas; Asia; Europe,,#NAME?,Americas; Asia; Europe,Americas; Asia; Europe; Europe,Americas; Asia; Europe; Europe

The idea to organize such an event reflected Czechoslovakia's interest in environmental planning and was one of the main outcomes of the country's science diplomacy in the field of global environmentalism in the late 1960s. Organized under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the meeting aimed to be an important stepping-stone in the formation of a new international institutional landscape related to the environment. UNECE, with its history of facilitating international cooperation across the Iron Curtain, provided an optimal platform for such an undertaking.

Global environmentalism","On the road to Stockholm: A case study of the failure of Cold War international environmental initiatives (Prague Symposium, 1971)In May 1971, the Czechoslovak capital hosted an international conference on the environment that brought together high-ranking government officials and scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain. The idea to organize such an event reflected Czechoslovakia's interest in environmental planning and was one of the main outcomes of the country's science diplomacy in the field of global environmentalism in the late 1960s. Organized under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the meeting aimed to be an important stepping-stone in the formation of a new international institutional landscape related to the environment. UNECE, with its history of facilitating international cooperation across the Iron Curtain, provided an optimal platform for such an undertaking. Nonetheless, the Symposium on Problems Relating to Environment was overshadowed by the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, the outcomes of which were instrumentalized by the Soviets to promote their own international policy aims associated with the Brezhnev Doctrine. Soviet authorities considered the environment to be a purely domestic issue and did not show much interest in pursuing international environmental cooperation.

Beck explain how the area of research on cognitive biases has made clear that the kinds of judgements people are likely to make may well be affected by their own baggage in the form of various biases and perceptual predispositions. Politicians and scientists, like the rest of us, may be affected by various biases. Cognitive biases anchor our understanding.

A recent initiative was launched for establishing the South-East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies (SEEIIST), a pan European research infrastructure (RI) which will provide a cutting-edge technology for (a) radiotherapy treatment with accelerated protons and ions and (b) multidisciplinary fundamental research involving accelerated ion beams. To justify the initiative for building the SEEIIST facility for cancer treatment, a study was conducted to estimate the time progress of the cancer incidence and mortality due to cancer in the countries of the SEE region. Methods and materials. The demography and the economic development of the SEE region were studied in relation to their emigration rate (brain drain). Time development of the incidence and mortality were studied for the SEE countries from the data available at Globocan of the IARC@WHO. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries' cancer datasheets from the World Health Organization (WHO). The top ten cancers were presented for the SEE countries and for the region as a whole. Results. From the available data it is evident that the incidence and the mortality, both grow with time in the SEE region, unlike in the developed European countries chosen for reference, where the mortality declines with time. The occurrence of breaking points in curves mortality vs. time is evident for all the analyzed SEE countries. Many of these points coincide with changes in the societal aspects (security, politics and/or economy). Conclusion. The emerging research infrastructure SEEIIST will mitigate the brain drain from SEE, and contribute in overcoming the historical friction in the turbulent Balkan region, offering research opportunities in many fields related to accelerated ions, foster, research, innovation and knowledge transfer, facilitate radiational therapy with particles to the cancer patients of the SEE region, reducing the growing cancer mortality, thereby. SEEIIST will be developed as a strong commitment of the SEE countries' governments and common effort in science diplomacy of the international community. The central research facility will be based in one of the ten SEE countries. In parallel with developing the principal RI, several SEEIIST HUBs and NETWORKs will be developed for different SEE countries in support to the SEEIIST sustainability. To provide sustainability of the SEEIIST RI, a GREEN energy HUB (Green power plant for powering SEEIIST) will be set. Also, an IT HUB (providing big data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence for SEEIIST), Imaging HUB (developing novel imaging solutions for ion therapy for SEEIIST), etc. Furthermore, several combined SEE and western European networks will be established, such as the Training network, Radiobiology Network, Network of Oncologists, Network of Veterinary scientists, with their central coordination offices located in different SEE countries, with the objective to start joint research related primarily to the cancer treatment but also to other research disciplines.",Balkans | Brain Drain | Breaking Points | Cancer epidemiology | Cancer in SEE region | Cancer Incidence | Cancer Mortality | Depopulation | Emigration | Science and diplomacy | SEEIIST,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,30-CE-0838742/00-87,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

The project aims to analyze the various practices of science diplomacy in the key periods of history, to compare the experience of different countries.

To deepen the innovation cooperation between Ukraine and Scandinavian countries, the authors see the need for: (1) expanding spheres of cooperation through joint projects in infrastructure, energy, aerospace and pharmaceutical industries, and the production of components for automobiles; (2) conducting joint research on biotechnology and nanotechnology; (3) signing of agreements in order to establish partnerships between the universities of Scandinavian countries and Ukraine; (4) the introduction of state support for the aerospace industry, the creation of scientific and production clusters in this field; (5) further development and diversification of the Ukrainian IT services market and interaction with Scandinavian countries in this field.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Their peoples are also among the first to be widely affected by global changes such as land degradation and climate change.

As a major developed dryland nation, Australia has previously played a major role in extending these innovations to the rest of the world. The nation has reaped reputational and commercial benefits through major research and practice contributions to dryland agriculture, water management and governance, remote area services, indigenous partnerships, dryland monitoring systems, and 'desert knowledge' innovation.

We analyse the Australian government's investment in research and in overseas aid for drylands over the last two decades, and explore trends in government's active involvement in major international processes related to land. These trends are short-sighted, overlooking potential economic benefits for Australian enterprises, and undermining Australia's stance and scientific leadership in dryland systems globally. In this commentary, we argue that it is time for the trends to be reversed, as this is an area of comparative advantage for Australian diplomacy with significant returns on investment for Australia, both direct and indirect, especially when most emerging economies contain substantial drylands. We identify four major pathways to obtaining benefits from science diplomacy, and four interrelated actions within Australia to enable these-to place a higher emphasis on science diplomacy, to re-forge a bipartisan recognition of Australian drylands expertise, to establish a dedicated Dryland Information Hub, and to create a network of relevant science and technology advisors.",comparative advantage | dryland agriculture | research for development | science diplomacy | sustainable development | theory of change,2,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text=""\n\n1.

These trends are short-sighted, overlooking potential economic benefits for Australian enterprises, and undermining Australia's stance and scientific leadership in dryland systems globally. In this commentary, we argue that it is time for the trends to be reversed, as this is an area of comparative advantage for Australian diplomacy with significant returns on investment for Australia, both direct and indirect, especially when most emerging economies contain substantial drylands. We identify four major pathways to obtaining benefits from science diplomacy, and four interrelated actions within Australia to enable these-to place a higher emphasis on science diplomacy, to re-forge a bipartisan recognition of Australian drylands expertise, to establish a dedicated Dryland Information Hub, and to create a network of relevant science and technology advisors.",yes,yes,Australia,Australia,Australia,None,None,Australia and New Zealand,,#NAME?,Australia and New Zealand,Australia and New Zealand,Oceania,,#NAME?,Oceania,Oceania,Oceania

On what grounds science diplomacy entertains these high hopes, however, has remained unclear, and—as a blind spot—unaddressed in a discourse mostly shaped by policy practitioners. Recognizing that the discourse on science diplomacy is still unspecific about how its means and ends should fit together and be comprehended, we reconstruct the concept and its discourse as a materialization of actors’ interpretative schemas and shared assumptions about the social world they constantly need to make sense of. Science diplomacy is presented as a panacea against looming threats and grand challenges in a world facing deterioration. The prerequisite for such a solutionistic narrative is a simplified portrait of diplomacy in need of help from science that—romanticized in this discourse—bears but positive properties and exerts rationalizing, collaborative and even pacifying effects on a generic international community in its collective efforts to tackle global challenges. We conclude that these interpretative schemas that idealize and mythify science as overall collaborative, rationalizing and complexity-reducing are problematic. First, because the discourse misconceives ideals and norms for real and will therefore disappoint social expectations, and second, because science is likely to be instrumentalised for political purposes.

The research covers 17 European states: six are Arctic and 11 non-Arctic, which were selected according to the following (at least one) formulated criteria: having an established tradition of carrying out scientific research in the Arctic region; having issued Arctic policy documents and/or Arctic research strategies; participation in the activities of the Arctic Council; and having gained membership of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC). In the analysis we have applied a mixed research method, since it incorporates elements of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and offers a more comprehensive review of the scrutinised texts. The qualitative analysis relies on a discourse analysis (predicate analysis). The quantitative part of the analysis utilizes the instruments of a software research tool – The AntConc.

The research covers 17 European states: six are Arctic and 11 non-Arctic, which were selected according to the following (at least one) formulated criteria: having an established tradition of carrying out scientific research in the Arctic region; having issued Arctic policy documents and/or Arctic research strategies; participation in the activities of the Arctic Council; and having gained membership of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC). In the analysis we have applied a mixed research method, since it incorporates elements of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and offers a more comprehensive review of the scrutinised texts. The qualitative analysis relies on a discourse analysis (predicate analysis). The quantitative part of the analysis utilizes the instruments of a software research tool – The AntConc.

On writing the history of “science diplomacy”This introduction examines the growing interest in science diplomacy and the parallel lack of in-depth historical studies on this new concept.

This study reduces science diplomacy to an effective means for the strategic development of nanotechnology in Africa. African nations are currently not encouragingly close to the leading nations in nanotechnology, yet there seem to be extant diplomatic relationship with many of these forefront nations. African diplomats are state actors in science diplomacy to propose foreign policies that will meet the domestic demand for science and technology development in Africa, especially for emerging technologies like nanotechnology. The necessity of inclusion of competent scientists with diplomatic skills as members of the diplomatic corps is recommended here as one of the ways to develop nanotechnology in Africa.

Science diplomacy","Engaging science diplomacy for nanotechnology development in AfricaThe concept of science diplomacy is gaining ground as a global strategy in addressing global concerns such as global peace, insecurity, climate change and environmental impact. This study reduces science diplomacy to an effective means for the strategic development of nanotechnology in Africa. African nations are currently not encouragingly close to the leading nations in nanotechnology, yet there seem to be extant diplomatic relationship with many of these forefront nations. African diplomats are state actors in science diplomacy to propose foreign policies that will meet the domestic demand for science and technology development in Africa, especially for emerging technologies like nanotechnology. The necessity of inclusion of competent scientists with diplomatic skills as members of the diplomatic corps is recommended here as one of the ways to develop nanotechnology in Africa. The scientist diplomats will function to foster international scientific collaborations, drive platforms for national research facility development and for non-state actors to thrive in their domestic nano-research. Scientifically informed foreign policies are presented here to have potentials to significantly assist Africa in developing nanotechnology and provide pathways for overcoming the numerous constraints to nanotechnology development in Africa.

Observing that current deliberations on global health focus largely, but rather narrowly, on what resource inputs are needed to achieve the SDG health targets, this paper goes further and highlights the importance of the ‘how’ in terms of a leadership and driving role for the RPs: How can the RPs champion global governance reform and innovation aimed at producing strong, resilient and equitable global systems? How can the RPs use soft power diplomacy to enhance disease surveillance and detection capacities and to promote improved regional and international coordination in response to health threats? How can they provide incentives for investment in R&D and manufacturing of medicines to tackle neglected and poverty-related diseases in developing countries?",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Scientists, being ‘neutral’ representatives of their countries, are looking for answers to the global challenges of our time, common to all of humanity. As Anton Chekhov said: ‘There is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what’s national is no longer a science’. Diplomats are people whose main task is to promote the interests and values of their country on the world stages; therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the development of scientific diplomacy in various countries. As a result of the study, the authors concluded that scientific diplomacy always reflects the interests of a state and therefore differs from international scientific cooperation. At the same time, there are many areas of common interest between science and diplomacy. Diplomats are interested in the key values of science – the universality and neutrality of knowledge, and they, in turn, can contribute to the activities of scientists.

- Scientific diplomacy","Global science diplomacy in the digital age: Socio-economic and legal layout of international scientific cooperationConventional diplomacy has always relied on scientific expertise. Scientists, being ‘neutral’ representatives of their countries, are looking for answers to the global challenges of our time, common to all of humanity. As Anton Chekhov said: ‘There is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what’s national is no longer a science’. Diplomats are people whose main task is to promote the interests and values of their country on the world stages; therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the development of scientific diplomacy in various countries. As a result of the study, the authors concluded that scientific diplomacy always reflects the interests of a state and therefore differs from international scientific cooperation. At the same time, there are many areas of common interest between science and diplomacy. Diplomats are interested in the key values of science – the universality and neutrality of knowledge, and they, in turn, can contribute to the activities of scientists. The authors conclude that there are many examples in history when scientific problems reached the level of diplomatic relations, and sometimes acted as their catalyst. On the contrary, diplomats often stimulated cooperation between countries in research, science, and technology.

The results of student surveys before, immediately after, and 9 months post-participation reveal the extent to which the design met objectives for learning, across genders. Our experimental conclusion reinforces the idea that even short-term, informal learning programs can elicit greater confidence, knowledge and abilities in all students, especially female students, when as many as possible of the elements known to improve gendered participation for STEM are taken into consideration into the very design of the experience.

The intervention incorporated various elements to promote gender-sensitive technical and cultural literacy through an international outreach and science diplomacy framework, justified by various kind of literature in STEM learning. We recount the experiences of three cohorts of students learning about impacts of climate change at sites in Bolivia, South Africa and Panama. The results of student surveys before, immediately after, and 9 months post-participation reveal the extent to which the design met objectives for learning, across genders. Our experimental conclusion reinforces the idea that even short-term, informal learning programs can elicit greater confidence, knowledge and abilities in all students, especially female students, when as many as possible of the elements known to improve gendered participation for STEM are taken into consideration into the very design of the experience.

The local level examines Norway's efforts to maintain effective occupation of greater Kongsfjorden by promoting research, underpinned by the economisation of the area's near-pristine natural environment as a non-extractive resource for science; the global level applies the concept of telecoupling to consider the role of events and processes at larger spatial scales that facilitated Ny-Ålesund's transformation; and the glocal level explains how the interaction of Norwegian and global actors in the locality of Ny-Ålesund have collectively shaped the community's institutions over some 30 years. The article also reflects on recent policy changes signalling more assertive Norwegian administration and greater coordination of research in Ny-Ålesund.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

It is argued that a deeper study of these differences might give important insights to properly understand the relevance of specific disciplines' scientific needs in the way the ideals and practices of scientific internationalism were actualised through the 20th century.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

A number of factors continue to drive this trend, but the most important one is the recognition that (1) more and more, major challenges are international in nature and that (2) science and its applications are part of the cause as well as the cure.

As the challenges of the world increasingly transcend borders, so too have researchers and innovators forged international coalitions to resolve global pathologies. In doing so, new channels of influence and opportunity have opened up for states alongside the ‘traditional’ modes of foreign diplomacy. Understanding how these channels influence global socio-economic outcomes is thereby crucial for scholars interested in the still-ambiguous structure and processes of global governance. This article advances understanding of the domains of science diplomacy by drawing attention to the ‘political intercostalities’ of state actors, scientific communities and other transnational actors within the new architectures of global governance. Here we trace the growing array of informal international associations alongside transgovernmental policy networks and ‘global public-policy partnerships’ that deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy and how they are drawn into science diplomacy.

As the challenges of the world increasingly transcend borders, so too have researchers and innovators forged international coalitions to resolve global pathologies. In doing so, new channels of influence and opportunity have opened up for states alongside the ‘traditional’ modes of foreign diplomacy. Understanding how these channels influence global socio-economic outcomes is thereby crucial for scholars interested in the still-ambiguous structure and processes of global governance. This article advances understanding of the domains of science diplomacy by drawing attention to the ‘political intercostalities’ of state actors, scientific communities and other transnational actors within the new architectures of global governance. Here we trace the growing array of informal international associations alongside transgovernmental policy networks and ‘global public-policy partnerships’ that deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy and how they are drawn into science diplomacy. This article thus presents a research agenda for a particular mode of ‘impact’ in politics and international studies.",yes,yes,none,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

The interest in examining the Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RTD&I) structures and policies in this country stems from the particularity of the above research governance structure in combination with the strong international commitment and involvement of its Transport related industries and the private sector. It also stems from the observation that Japan is a relatively speaking “slow mover” when it comes to institutional or cultural change as well as a relatively “closed” system, regarding RTD&I. Its official efforts to embrace new thinking, seem in conflict with a systemic resistance to change and this may create sub-optimal or even contradictory policies and programs that could compromise Japan’s efforts to regain its RTD&I prominence globally and in East Asia. This chapter examines all these issues in a systematic and thorough way starting with an examination of the background to economic change in Japan and the emergence of its Science and Technology Basic Plans . It then proceeds to examine the Japanese research governance and funding system and its main international RTD&I collaboration policies and activities. It also focuses on transport research and examines its place in the overall Japanese RTD&I system, its principal stakeholders, and gives specific examples of current Japanese international RTD&I cooperation efforts in the transport sector. The Chapter concludes that even if Japan is able to establish an optimal RTD&I international cooperation policy, there are a number of factors that will continue to slow its ability to compete on the RTD&I front. These include an aging population that is highly dependent on social services and thus absorbing many public funding resources; the “insular” culture in the country that is biased against significant participation by foreign scientists; the corresponding reluctance of foreign scientists to relocate to Japan; the growing labour costs; and an apparent reluctance to encourage foreign investment for RTD&I in Japan. In the field of transport, Japan (especially the Japanese private sector) is making considerable progress in establishing international transportation RTD&I collaborations with Europe, the United States, and other countries of East Asia. A major sign of this progress is Japan’s so called ST&I diplomacy relationships primarily with other East Asian governments. This maybe driven by competition considerations and the potential for finding new markets but it is still a very significant “opening” of the Japanese RTD&I system to the outside world. The Chapter provides a SWOT analysis to examine and evaluate these initiatives and the numerous opportunities for greater collaboration between Japan and other countries.

The Paris Climate Talks considered a number of issues related to intellectual property, technology transfer, and finance. Draft Article 56.3 laid down a number of options. The first option suggested a number of possibilities to facilitate technology transfer. Item A suggested that developed countries ‘provide financial resources to address barriers caused by intellectual property rights (IPRs) and facilitate access to and the deployment of technology, including inter alia, by utilizing the Financial Mechanism and/or the establishment of a funding window under the Green Climate Fund/the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism.' Item B called for ‘an international mechanism on IPRs to be established to facilitate access to and the deployment of technology to [developing country Parties].' Item C asked for other arrangements to be established to address intellectual property rights-such as ‘collaborative research and development, shareware, commitments related to humanitarian or preferential licensing, fully paid-up or joint licensing schemes, preferential rates and patent pools.' Item D suggested that ‘funds from the Green Climate Fund will be utilized to meet the full costs of intellectual property rights (IPRs) of environmentally sound technologies and know-how and such technologies will be provided to developing country Parties free of cost in order to enhance their actions to address climate change and its adverse impacts.' The second option was that ‘Parties recognize that IPRs create an enabling environment for the promotion of technology innovation in environmentally sound technologies.' The third option favoured by developed countries is that ‘IPRs are not to be addressed in this agreement.' The fourth option was for ‘Developed country Parties to make available Intellectual Property (IP) through multilateral institutions as public good, through purchase of intellectual property.' The Paris Climate Talks saw a number of announcements on innovation-including Mission Innovation, and the International Solar Alliance. At the Paris talks, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi contended that: ‘Our innovation initiative should be driven by public purpose, not just market incentives, including on IP.' He emphasized that: ‘We need to scale up the Green Climate Fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property.' For his part, US President Barack Obama flagged that he was willing to engage in a dialogue over matters of technology transfer. In the end, there was text on technology transfer in the Paris Agreement 2015-but no substantive text on intellectual property and climate change.",Climate change | Climate finance | Commons | Diplomacy | Green climate fund | Intellectual property | International law | Open innovation | Technology transfer | The paris agreement 2015 | UNFCCC climate technology centre and network,5,0,,,,undefined,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n\n\n1.

Paris Agreement 2015","The Paris agreement: Intellectual property, technology transfer, and climate changeIn the lead up to the Paris Agreement 2015, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has commented: ‘Intellectual property, technology transfer, and financing are among a wide range of topics that must be addressed in the context of climate change and sustainable development’. The Paris Climate Talks considered a number of issues related to intellectual property, technology transfer, and finance. Draft Article 56.3 laid down a number of options. The first option suggested a number of possibilities to facilitate technology transfer. Item A suggested that developed countries ‘provide financial resources to address barriers caused by intellectual property rights (IPRs) and facilitate access to and the deployment of technology, including inter alia, by utilizing the Financial Mechanism and/or the establishment of a funding window under the Green Climate Fund/the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism.' Item B called for ‘an international mechanism on IPRs to be established to facilitate access to and the deployment of technology to [developing country Parties].' Item C asked for other arrangements to be established to address intellectual property rights-such as ‘collaborative research and development, shareware, commitments related to humanitarian or preferential licensing, fully paid-up or joint licensing schemes, preferential rates and patent pools.' Item D suggested that ‘funds from the Green Climate Fund will be utilized to meet the full costs of intellectual property rights (IPRs) of environmentally sound technologies and know-how and such technologies will be provided to developing country Parties free of cost in order to enhance their actions to address climate change and its adverse impacts.' The second option was that ‘Parties recognize that IPRs create an enabling environment for the promotion of technology innovation in environmentally sound technologies.' The third option favoured by developed countries is that ‘IPRs are not to be addressed in this agreement.' The fourth option was for ‘Developed country Parties to make available Intellectual Property (IP) through multilateral institutions as public good, through purchase of intellectual property.' The Paris Climate Talks saw a number of announcements on innovation-including Mission Innovation, and the International Solar Alliance. At the Paris talks, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi contended that: ‘Our innovation initiative should be driven by public purpose, not just market incentives, including on IP.' He emphasized that: ‘We need to scale up the Green Climate Fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property.' For his part, US President Barack Obama flagged that he was willing to engage in a dialogue over matters of technology transfer. In the end, there was text on technology transfer in the Paris Agreement 2015-but no substantive text on intellectual property and climate change.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

The article considers strategic documents of 19 countries to identify three types of them: the first group consists of countries with a special strategic document on international scientific-technical cooperation; the second group — of countries with a document on regional scientific-technical cooperation; the third group — of countries whose policies in the field of international scientific-technical cooperation are represented in national strategies for the development of science and technology and are integrated into action plans/strategies of the relevant departments. The article describes the organization of international scientific-technical cooperation in the USA, Mexico and Sweden. Thus, the USA developed a distributed system of coordination of international scientific activities under the uniform national approach, when science is considered an instrument of American foreign policy. Mexico follows a regional line in international scientific-technical cooperation without any special document regulating it. In Sweden, international scientific cooperation is considered a part of foreign policy and is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The article considers strategic documents of 19 countries to identify three types of them: the first group consists of countries with a special strategic document on international scientific-technical cooperation; the second group — of countries with a document on regional scientific-technical cooperation; the third group — of countries whose policies in the field of international scientific-technical cooperation are represented in national strategies for the development of science and technology and are integrated into action plans/strategies of the relevant departments. The article describes the organization of international scientific-technical cooperation in the USA, Mexico and Sweden. Thus, the USA developed a distributed system of coordination of international scientific activities under the uniform national approach, when science is considered an instrument of American foreign policy. Mexico follows a regional line in international scientific-technical cooperation without any special document regulating it. In Sweden, international scientific cooperation is considered a part of foreign policy and is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Based on the studied documents, the authors make several suggestions for Russian scientific-technical policy that have been already used in the draft Conception of International Scientific-Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation.

Gómez draws on extensive data and case studies and argues that leaders aspiring to build their reputations among elite nations have a ready way to demonstrate their status through quick and effective public health responses, whereas those who scorn the international community tend to react slowly and ineffectively to the same type of crises.

In 1942, Frank Wilson, an internationally recognized pioneer in electrocar-diography, made an extended wartime visit to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The visit was sponsored by the United States Department of State as part of Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy and brought Wilson together with a group of physicians who would establish the specialty of cardiology in Brazil.

In 1942, Frank Wilson, an internationally recognized pioneer in electrocar-diography, made an extended wartime visit to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The visit was sponsored by the United States Department of State as part of Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy and brought Wilson together with a group of physicians who would establish the specialty of cardiology in Brazil.

It deals with the MFA's increasing role in foreign economic policy, on the one hand, and the share of economic agenda in diplomats' work, on the other. In order to achieve these goals, the author provides an analysis of functioning of the French national system of economic diplomacy, which since 2012 has undergone a process of restructuring, aimed at enhancing the role of the ministry of foreign affairs in regulating of foreign economic activities. In fact, this reform constituted the government's reaction to the financial and economic crisis of the Eurozone in 2011-2012. The article examines the key dimensions of the current reform: activation of the ""French teams""; personal involvement of the Minister of foreign affairs into economic diplomacy issues; promoting French high technologies and innovations on the world markets; diversification of foreign investment inflows in favor of developing countries; support of the foreign economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises; introduction of a facilitated visa regime for businessmen from countries considered strategic partners. The article casts light upon the recent structural transformations in the economic diplomacy service, especially, on the establishment of the Directorate for French companies and the world economy at the MFA, introduction of the new positions dealing with foreign economic activities, as well as organizations of events aimed at promoting economic ties. It also contains preliminary results of the reforms depicted by the dynamics of FDI flows, number and price of contracts between French companies and foreign investors, job growth on joint enterprises, number of French business units penetrating foreign markets.

Functional diplomacy tracks","The economization of diplomatic service and scientific diplomacy in developed countries: French experienceThe article focuses on the trend towards economization of the ministries of foreign affairs in many developed countries, using the case of the French diplomatic service. It deals with the MFA's increasing role in foreign economic policy, on the one hand, and the share of economic agenda in diplomats' work, on the other. In order to achieve these goals, the author provides an analysis of functioning of the French national system of economic diplomacy, which since 2012 has undergone a process of restructuring, aimed at enhancing the role of the ministry of foreign affairs in regulating of foreign economic activities. In fact, this reform constituted the government's reaction to the financial and economic crisis of the Eurozone in 2011-2012. The article examines the key dimensions of the current reform: activation of the ""French teams""; personal involvement of the Minister of foreign affairs into economic diplomacy issues; promoting French high technologies and innovations on the world markets; diversification of foreign investment inflows in favor of developing countries; support of the foreign economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises; introduction of a facilitated visa regime for businessmen from countries considered strategic partners. The article casts light upon the recent structural transformations in the economic diplomacy service, especially, on the establishment of the Directorate for French companies and the world economy at the MFA, introduction of the new positions dealing with foreign economic activities, as well as organizations of events aimed at promoting economic ties. It also contains preliminary results of the reforms depicted by the dynamics of FDI flows, number and price of contracts between French companies and foreign investors, job growth on joint enterprises, number of French business units penetrating foreign markets. The author outlines the trend of the MFA playing a dominant role in the elaboration of the general foreign economic strategy alongside tactical policy-making.

Contributing to this success was China’s emergence as a more positive participant in the international climate change negotiations. Despite efforts to reduce energy and carbon intensity since the mid-2000s, Chinese negotiators in Copenhagen were careful not to link domestic action on climate change to any presumptions of international obligation. This stands in marked contrast to Paris where, for the first time, China was willing to commit to an absolute cap on emissions subject to international measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV). This article examines what changed between 2009 and 2015 such that China was able to play a more constructive role in the global climate regime. It argues that a key driver of change was China’s shift to a ‘New Normal’ model of economic development. Beginning in the 12th Five Year Plan Period (2011–2015), China’s economic policy prioritized a transition from energy-intensive growth based on heavy industry, exports and investment, to a more balanced economy characterized by slower growth, an increasing role for services and domestic consumption, and a focus on innovation and low-carbon technologies. This transition gave China the opportunity to re-formulate its priorities in international climate negotiations and helped pave the way for increased climate cooperation with the US, the lack of which had been a major roadblock to success in Copenhagen. Progress was further facilitated by a range of external factors, including impressive French diplomacy in the run-up to COP21 and the important shift to a bottom-up, voluntary approach to commitments. Policy relevance This article analyses the reasons behind China’s more constructive engagement at COP 21 in Paris, which contributed to the Conference’s successful outcome. It is important for policy makers to better comprehend China’s shifting position and the motivations behind it, given the country’s key role in keeping temperature rise at a safe level.

Building on previous activities and new partnerships, UNOOSA facilitates and provides (i) access to space education; (ii) access to space data; (iii) access to space technology and research facilities; and finally, for the first time, (iv) direct access to space. At the core of these activities is microgravity research, from on-ground simulation to orbital opportunities, which is one of the main tools of the Human Space Technology Initiative. This shift from on-ground space education, applications, technology and simulation to on-orbit technology is directly linked to a UNISPACE+50 thematic priority on ""Global partnerships in space exploration and innovation"". At this stage, three partnership programmes are incorporated in this strategy, with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the China Manned Space Agency, and Sierra Nevada Corporation. These programmes provide access to a wide spectrum of Low Earth Orbit opportunities.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Why are we surprised when cyber-attacks disrupt our IT systems, internal spies publish our protected information, mentally ill or volatile individuals attack police and innocent people, and trusted state or federal employees turn out to be untrustworthy and release critical secrets to enemies or the world? These are all attributable to failures in the ability of people to work together, or collaborate, for our protection. The failure is not that of the first responders or warfighters, to whom this book is dedicated. On the contrary, these heroes must show superior initiative and risk self-sacrifice while the stove-piped-organization system planners and vendors with no skin in the game risk nothing. These leaders, planners, scientists, engineers, managers, administrators, salespeople and others are wholly responsible for the technological innovation, processes and products used, but these people are almost never on-scene when an incident occurs. Part I of our book explains to both the general reader and homeland security experts alike, what individual and organizational factors are needed to establish a collaborative environment. These factors include organizational trust, knowledge management, organizational structure, organizational culture, and leadership. These collaboration factors provide the basis for Part II, where we look at the important contributions of actual homeland security practitioners. These practitioners describe the role of human collaboration in making peace, bombing the Third Reich (by a member of the Greatest Generation), disaster management, public safety communications interoperability, electric power restoration, medical support for mass sheltering, government healthcare, cybersecurity, science diplomacy, technology innovation, government acquisition, systems engineering, and intellectual property litigation. Finally, in Part III, we describe a methodology for comprehensive collaboration planning (CCP) to optimize planning for day-to-day or rare ""grey swan"" or unexpected ""black swan"" events. In the end, we show that achieving these five collaboration factors ultimately requires direct interaction between the people involved in any homeland security endeavor, and not the technology they envision, develop, buy, sell, deploy, operate and sustain. It does not matter what you buy if the people who use it - or with whom they must collaborate in a crisis as well as day-to-day unexpected events - do not have their act together. The bottom line is that how well people do together in any homeland security (or other) domain depends exclusively on the success of human-to-human interoperability and interaction. This interaction is governed by long-known and waning (in an e-world) rules of civility, such as George Washington documented and practiced some time ago.

It emphasizes the importance of adopting an historical perspective, highlighting the circumstances surrounding the consolidation of the current international system, whereby, after two world wars, the victorious countries created the United Nations Organization, which today brings together all the world’s nations, notwithstanding the fact that the majority of countries are in favor of significant changes to its institutional framework. It also stresses the importance of the bioethics dimension, despite the systematic disregard of principles adopted in relevant UN documents, especially in view of inequalities pari passu with asymmetries of knowledge and enjoyment of innovations that separate nations. This reflection also suggests that South-South cooperation is fundamental to the analysis of the inequality and dependence that demarcate North-South and East-West bipolarity. These reflections are, in short, important guiding elements for deepening analysis and resolutions in the arena of international cooperation for health, leaving aside catastrophic visions and idealistic illusions.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

This chapter will explore the definition of science diplomacy and its functions, describe the types of individuals that practice science diplomacy, suggest potential resources and list potential challenges, discuss the key role of Diaspora in science diplomacy, and outline best practices. It will also describe the global organizations that specifically promote geosciences engagement, such as the international unions for the geosciences, and others working on Earth system science issues, including both academic programs and global bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UNESCO. From this point of view, it will describe the roles and activities of the US National Committees for the international geosciences unions hosted by the US National Academy of Sciences and will present case studies of geosciences diplomacy excellence, such as the US Geological Survey-Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance’s Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP). Though this discussion will be done largely from the US perspective, the underlying concepts should be applicable around the world. The issues of global climate change and natural hazard risk communication in many instances involve interactions across cultures and across boundaries. An understanding of the diplomacy element in those interactions, and the integration of those approaches in the planning and establishment of those programs will increase their likelihood of success.",yes,yes,United States of America,United States of America,United States of America,None,None,Northern America,,#NAME?,Northern America,Northern America ,Americas,,#NAME?,Americas,Americas,Americas

Additionally, it is fundamental to raise the debate about the energy development in the Arctic and the fact that the exploration of oil and gas resources in the Arctic cannot be performed with the current governance regime, policies and legal framework. Arctic-specific natural ecosystems, the presence of indigenous communities and the commercial interest in the region will require an innovative model of development based on the highest level of responsible exploitation, diplomacy, regulation and policy-making. Design/methodology/approach – This is an unexplored subject but the paper uses a review of past and recent literature, outcomes of recent “petit comités” with some of the involved parties, as a vehicle to discuss possible new approaches and paths for the future development of an innovative model of environmental governance relating to energy development in the Arctic region. Findings – This paper demonstrates the necessity of improving the current governance patterns, as the author believes that energy development will have both positive and negative impacts on micro and macro levels. The first relevant contribution of these operations in the Arctic, undoubtedly, is the benefit for energy security levels at a global platform; however, the framework built up in terms of new legal cooperation agreements, policy-making and technological innovation in different areas will define the new Arctic citizenship as well as the Arctic’s geopolitics, and, consequently, the region’s destiny.

New literature about the region dynamics is being developed, as new licensing process is ongoing, and there are more questions than answers about open space for reflection and decision-making. Important data have not been published or shared in “petit comités” due to strategic interests and confidentiality reasons. Practical implications – The major drivers of change could be described as energy security, climate change and transportation that will have a huge direct impact in the region under social, economic and environmental perspectives. The core practical implication of this reflection is the energy development model for the Arctic region. Social implications – How the Arctic’s energy resources will contribute to the global energy mix in the decades to come and the impacts of the governance regime to Arctic and non-Arctic societies is the first relevant question. Another fundamental aspect with huge social implications is how the climate changes will impact the Arctic environment and societies. These are themes that deserve more study and deeper analysis. Originality/value – The paper provides a deep reflection of the challenges and future trends involving the new frontiers of the world energy exploration. Multidisciplinary dialogue and research on all aspects of offshore oil and gas development will require a shift in the current conceptual view of the Arctic as well as in the multilateral efforts to negotiate and design an efficient Arctic governance regime that goes beyond the setting of new standards of spill prevention, preparedness and safety, but a regime that congregates the Arctic and Non-Arctic nations’ experience, workforce and leadership.",Arctic | Climate-change | Energy | Geopolitics | Governance | Hydrocarbons,10,0,,,,undefined,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\nList of names:\n\n1.

During the transition period of the international economic and social development and the critical transformation period of the world geopolitical pattern reorganization, China’s industrialization is still at the intermediate stage, and tackling with climate change is also China’s internal demand under this development stage. With more influence of climate change on national competitiveness, climate change and geopolitics present complex multiple relations, and climate change in the era of geopolitical landscape gradually affected the national strategy and diplomacy.

Prime Minister Abe wishes to regain Japan’s confi dence in the world as a leading country-‘like it used to be in the 1980s’-through both his economic policy (‘Abenomics’) and diplomacy strengthening alliances with the countries with ‘common values’.",yes,yes,Japan; United States of America; China; South Korea,United States of America; China; Japan,Japan; United States of America; China; South Korea,None; None; None; None ,None; None; None; None,Northern America; Eastern Asia,,#NAME?,Northern America; Eastern Asia,Eastern Asia; Northern America; Eastern Asia; Eastern Asia,Americas; Asia,,#NAME?,Americas; Asia,Asia; Americas; Asia; Asia,Asia; Americas; Asia; Asia

We conclude with a neglected voice from the global health frontlines, the American University of Iraq in Sulaimani, and suggest that many similar global regions are now poised for micro-grant enabled collective innovation to harness the 21st century digital commons. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

She has built legacies in academia, industry, government, and science diplomacy through more than 130 journal publications in computational bioengineering, her work building a multiscale modeling funding program and directing US$290 million in annual grant funding for 200 projects at the National Science Foundation (NSF), her career-long dedication to providing opportunities for women engineers, and most recently her efforts to foster collaborative research efforts between the United States and Turkey. With her return home, she completes a circle, reverses her diaspora, and at the same time becomes a larger part of an effort to bring science to the global community. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",yes,yes,Turkey; United States of America,United States of America; Turkey,Turkey; United States of America,None; None,None; None,Northern America; Western Asia,,#NAME?,Northern America; Western Asia,Western Asia; Northern America,Americas; Asia,,#NAME?,Americas; Asia,Asia; Americas ,Asia; Americas

The crucial question is to what extent developing countries can participate in this nascent healthcare facet in the 21st century? In Iran, this issue is even more challenging due to several cross-cutting factors such as inadequate financial and skilled human resources and importantly, sanctions on the import of a wide array of technologies that have seriously affected advanced proteomic instruments such as mass spectrometry. Apart from these barriers, another drawback is the inadequate incorporation of high-throughput data into cancer clinical settings. The available instruments in Iran are essentially limited to the level of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis equipment. However, opportunity still exists for collaboration with proteomic centers equipped with mass spectrometry abroad while local scientists contributing to proteomics study conception, design and implementation. In this article, we discuss the current OMICS data-intensive research conducted in Iran, with a view to ""proteomics-in-oncology"", considering in parallel the effects of international sanctions on the ongoing research in the country.

The crucial question is to what extent developing countries can participate in this nascent healthcare facet in the 21st century? In Iran, this issue is even more challenging due to several cross-cutting factors such as inadequate financial and skilled human resources and importantly, sanctions on the import of a wide array of technologies that have seriously affected advanced proteomic instruments such as mass spectrometry. Apart from these barriers, another drawback is the inadequate incorporation of high-throughput data into cancer clinical settings. The available instruments in Iran are essentially limited to the level of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis equipment. However, opportunity still exists for collaboration with proteomic centers equipped with mass spectrometry abroad while local scientists contributing to proteomics study conception, design and implementation. In this article, we discuss the current OMICS data-intensive research conducted in Iran, with a view to ""proteomics-in-oncology"", considering in parallel the effects of international sanctions on the ongoing research in the country. The lessons learned have broad importance to inform the global personalized medicine scientific community on the ways in which postgenomics science is presently making strides in resource-limited settings. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",yes,no,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

Science and technology increasingly appear as a main source of competitive and sustainable advantage for nations and regions alike. However, the key determinant of their efficacy is the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship-enabled innovation that unlocks and captures the pecuniary benefits of the science enterprise in the form of private, public, or hybrid goods. In this context, linking university basic and applied research with the market, via technology transfer and commercialization mechanisms including government-university-industry partnerships and risk capital investments, constitutes the essential trigger mechanism and driving device for sustainable competitive advantage and prosperity. In short, university researchers properly informed, empowered, and supported are bound to emerge as the architects of a prosperity that is founded on a solid foundation of scientific and technological knowledge, experience, and expertise and not in fleeting and conjectural "" financial engineering"" schemes.

Investors.","The Innovation Diplomacy Concept and the Hellenic-American Innovation Bridge as a Special Case-in-PointDeveloped and developing economies alike face increased resource scarcity and competitive rivalry. Science and technology increasingly appear as a main source of competitive and sustainable advantage for nations and regions alike. However, the key determinant of their efficacy is the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship-enabled innovation that unlocks and captures the pecuniary benefits of the science enterprise in the form of private, public, or hybrid goods. In this context, linking university basic and applied research with the market, via technology transfer and commercialization mechanisms including government-university-industry partnerships and risk capital investments, constitutes the essential trigger mechanism and driving device for sustainable competitive advantage and prosperity. In short, university researchers properly informed, empowered, and supported are bound to emerge as the architects of a prosperity that is founded on a solid foundation of scientific and technological knowledge, experience, and expertise and not in fleeting and conjectural "" financial engineering"" schemes. Building on these constituent elements of technology transfer and commercialization, Innovation Diplomacy encompasses the concept and practice of bridging distance and other divides (cultural, socio-economic, technological, etc.) with focused and properly targeted initiatives to connect ideas and solutions with markets and investors ready to appreciate them and nurture them to their full potential. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",yes,no ,,,,,,,,#NAME?,,,,,#NAME?,,,

This act states that Department of State (DOS) is the lead federal agency in developing S and T agreements. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282) states that the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is to advise the President on international S and T cooperation policies and the role of S and T considerations in foreign relations. DOS sets the overall policy direction for U.S. international S&T diplomacy, and works with other federal agencies as needed. Within DOS, the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) coordinates international S&T activities. The Science and Technology Advisor to the Secretary of State (STAS) provides S&T advice to the Secretary and the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). OSTP acts as a interagency liaison. A number of federal agencies that both sponsor research and use S&T in developing policy are involved in international S&T policy. A fundamental question is why the United States should invest in international S&T diplomacy instead of domestic research and development (R&D) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (STEM) activities, which are facing budget constraints.

Professor S. V. Komisarenko, Director of Palladin Institute of Biochemistry, Full Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, President of the Ukrainian Biochemical Society (since 1999), editor-in-chief Ukrainian Biochemical Journal (1989-1992 and since 1998), Academician-Secretary and Member of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (since April 2004) is a physician by education, molecular biologist by the calling, biochemist-immunologist by profession. He was one of the first researchers in our country who started systematic investigations in the field of molecular immunology, created a powerful world-famous scientific school, and made great contribution to solution of the acute problems of public health. He has proposed a new anti-tumor preparation MEBIFON which is produced at pharmaceutical firm Farmak in Kyiv. He was one of the first in the former USSR who introduced a hybridom technique for obtaining monoclonal antibodies. S. Komisarenko was awarded the State Prize of the Ukr.

What is in common?--Academician Serhiǐ KomisarenkoThe paper is dedicated to the history of creation and development of a new trend of scientific investigations in Palladin Institute of Biochemistry of NAS of Ukraine and Ukraine as a whole, - molecular immunology - in the context of scientific, scientific-organizational, pedagogical, social and political activity of Serhiy Vasyliovych Komisarenko. Professor S. V. Komisarenko, Director of Palladin Institute of Biochemistry, Full Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, President of the Ukrainian Biochemical Society (since 1999), editor-in-chief Ukrainian Biochemical Journal (1989-1992 and since 1998), Academician-Secretary and Member of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (since April 2004) is a physician by education, molecular biologist by the calling, biochemist-immunologist by profession. He was one of the first researchers in our country who started systematic investigations in the field of molecular immunology, created a powerful world-famous scientific school, and made great contribution to solution of the acute problems of public health. He has proposed a new anti-tumor preparation MEBIFON which is produced at pharmaceutical firm Farmak in Kyiv. He was one of the first in the former USSR who introduced a hybridom technique for obtaining monoclonal antibodies. S. Komisarenko was awarded the State Prize of the Ukr. SSR (1979) for immunochemical investigation of milk for babies. He proved that small doses of total radiation cause essential inhibition of natural immunity, which he called ""the Chernobyl AIDS"".

Divergent value systems lead to questioning of the legitimacy and equity of derivative or imitative innovation: Can innovation become an act of unfair competition? What bright line divides biopiracy from legitimate trade? In the negotiating coinage of 'knowledge diplomacy' (Ryan, 1998), innovation is offset against the protection of heritage and traditional values; concerns that imitative innovation may be a form of misappropriation can lead to the withdrawal of 'knowledge resources' from the 'common heritage' or from a contested 'public domain' to become a 'form of national property' (Kloppenburg, 1988) or a protected collective commons.

The impacts of science and technology on international affairs, especially those of information and communication technologies, are particularly pervasive. The mutual influences of science, technology and international affairs are so important and pervasive that the field should be recognized as an independent sub-discipline. Its present status as a relatively esoteric topic, to be entrusted to specialists and kept more or less isolated from the main body of international relations, is a dangerous anachronism. These impacts may be classified as operating through one of four main mechanisms: (1) changing the architecture of the international system: Its structure, its key organizing concepts, and the relations among its actors; (2) changing the processes by which the international system operates, including diplomacy, war, administration, policy formation, commerce, trade, finance, communications, and the gathering of intelligence; (3) creating new issue areas, new constraints and trade-offs in the operational environment of foreign policy, a term which includes not only political constraints on international action, but also constraints imposed by the laws of natural and social science; and (4) providing a source of changed perceptions, of information and transparency for the operation of the international system, and of new concepts and ideas for international relations theory. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Military R&D not only absorbs the best scientific and technological talent, but also distorts priorities in scientific research itself. Having forged a symbiotic relationship with the structures of economy, politics and state bureaucracy, it has acquired an autonomous and self-propelling existence, making of the armaments race an exponential curve - rapid and steep and unending - and defying any kind of social control. Military R&D has also become an instrument of diplomacy; it blocks all attempts at arms limitation, even on a very modest scale, by vitiating the very negotiating process: efforts to achieve quantitative limitations are offset by qualitative compensations, and arms control negotiation is turned into a collaborative exercise in armaments escalation. Above all, military R&D gobbles up the resources that could well go to relieving mass poverty and providing the basic necessities of life to people around the world.
