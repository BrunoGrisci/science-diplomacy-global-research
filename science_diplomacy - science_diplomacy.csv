This will require a better understanding of risk, but also of the interconnections between the climate and disaster agendas. This is vital for legislators to strategically apply their capabilities to achieving the targets outlined by their respective national governments. The role of individual national parliamentarians in advancing the priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction remains largely unexplored in scholarly research. However, these individuals play pivotal social and political roles with varying degrees of power, networks, and local influence. Such roles can enhance communities' capacity to participate in building disaster resilience. A significant hurdle for parliamentarians is comprehending the priorities and mechanisms necessary to develop a robust and coherent disaster risk management system. This involves navigating the intricate conceptual dimensions of the disaster risk reduction agenda and bridging these concepts with their everyday functions as parliamentarians. We contend that field briefings and co-production offer an effective platform for enhancing parliamentarians' capacity to grasp the concepts surrounding climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. This article presents reflections drawn from a parliamentary training on climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction with insights from the three-day capacity-building workshop with national legislators from the Americas and the Caribbean. The project was done in partnership between the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and an inter-parliamentary organization.",Climate adaptation | Climate risk | Co-production | Disaster risk reduction | Experiential learning | Parliamentarians | Science diplomacy,0,0,,,,undefined,

Of particular interest is the case of establishing in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation of national biological monitoring network - the initiative supported by the government-funded mega-grant programme. Our analysis suggests that two pillars of science diplomacy - science for diplomacy and diplomacy for science - can be successfully combined within the framework of one project. Evidence is provided of the pursuit of national interests being not a limiting factor but rather a driver in the process of promoting diplomatic collaborations in science, serving as a third science diplomacy pillar. Significant progress towards ensuring peace and harmony in the Arctic and sustaining international dialogue on science-based responses to global challenges has been achieved through science diplomacy initiatives proposed by Northern (Arctic) Federal University (NArFU).

Evaluating the role of environmental protection in Arctic governance within models of science diplomacy, this paper argues that the assumption of environmental responsibility should act as a normative operator for Arctic environmental governance, shaping the relations between actors in this regional network and legitimising decision-making by Arctic states as they socially construct the mechanisms and regional exceptionalism of Arctic governance. However, environmental responsibility falls short of acting as a normative operator for environmental protection that also prevents the impact of climate change on the Arctic environment, excluding its function as an overarching normative operator for the international system, reducing state legitimacy for regional decision-making in extra-territorial spaces.",Arctic region | Environment | Governance | Responsibility | Science diplomacy,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,Nord universitet

One of the world's top five fishing grounds, sovereignty disputes continue to bedevil joint fisheries management in the SCS. To develop new norms and standards for regional cooperation, and to support parallel domestic fisheries policymaking, scientists from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam overcame political constraints and data limitations, to develop a Common Fisheries Resource Analysis (CFRA) of skipjack tuna (SKJ). A valuable highly migratory species SKJ is fished extensively by SCS states, but regionally, was previously, unassessed. Applying Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio assessment to evaluate catch size compositions within a Weight of Evidence framework, we conclude fishing targeted at adult stocks would probably be sustainable, but for the continuing intensification of fishing for juveniles. Fishing pressure is apparently eroding SCS food webs and serially depleting local stocks. We conclude, domestic policies need to be developed to halt the continuing expansion of fishing fleets, and reduce fishing pressure, particularly on juvenile fish. The challenge of policy development and implementation requires the support of international frameworks, like Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), to regularise cooperation between government and non-government scientists of coastal states The existing Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) could provide that framework, unfortunately, intensifying geopolitical competition makes that extremely unlikely.",Data-poor assessment | Katsuwonus pelamis | RFMO | Science diplomacy | UNCLOS | Weight of evidence,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

Despite this generalization, we still lack an understanding of the sense practitioners make of ocean science diplomacy. This paper reports on perceptions of ocean science diplomacy collected through twenty in-depth interviews with South and North Atlantic government officials and researchers involved in the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance. In principle, interviewees perceive ocean science diplomacy as a positive and critically important phenomenon that combines the best of science and diplomacy. However, below this generally positive perception, there seems to be a polarization of power between science and policy and also between South and North Atlantic perspectives. Scientists have reported feeling suspicious of policymaking processes, while officials portray science as unaccountable and segregated from policy. South Atlantic researchers expressed concern over limited research capabilities, and officials reported an openness to the scientific evidence presented by scientists. Northern interviewees, with reported enhanced research capabilities, seem more inclined to search for the right scientific evidence in support of national political goals. A preconceived sense of the other is what seems to permeate South-North Atlantic relationships. Northern subjects make sense of their Southern peers as those in need of assistance, while Southern interviewees claimed being unheard and victims of tokenism.

These pathways need to be comprehensive and ?exible in order to adapt to changing technologies and competencies and address large societal challenges hindering equity and opportunity. One approach that considers both of these aspects is cross-sector coalition building; from schools, universities, and other practitioners, to industry partners, government entities, and community organizations. International partnerships can further deepen knowledge derived from these coalitions, providing a broader context that enables coalitions to better support education pathways. In this panel discussion, computing education experts from the United States, Thailand, and Botswana will discuss current computing education e?orts in their country and how they are leveraging international partners to build coalitions and create equitable computing education pathways. They will highlight strategies unique to the particular context of their nations, while also discussing shared challenges and opportunities that can be addressed through international cooperation in education research. The overarching goals are 1) to engage the audience in a conversation about how researchers and practitioners can leverage and create global networks in their own work to create equitable opportunities in computing education and 2) to share resources and examples of how international perspectives can provide new insights into computing education research. The session format will be a combination of moderated panel discussion and audience interaction. The timeline of the session is as follows: • The Panel Moderator will poll the audience in the room and online to determine the representation of countries in attendance. This will help foster a sense of inclusion and generate energy for participants to identify potential collaborators in the session. The Panel Moderator will then provide an overview of the session goals and objectives as listed above and brie?y introduce each panelist (5-7 min). • Panelists will then provide an overview of computing education e?orts in their respective countries, highlighting examples of cross-sector and international partnerships that have enabled their work (15 min). • The Panel Moderator will facilitate a discussion with panelists about the resources, strategies, and assessments needed to successfully build a computing education coalition with international partners. The Panel Moderator will also ask panelists to share their thoughts on issues and challenges in computing education that can and/or possibly should be addressed through international cooperation. Finally, the Panel Moderator will ask panelists to comment on how participants might begin to form their own global partnerships, with special attention to the growing importance of communicating in a virtual environment. • Audience Q and A from in-person and virtual participants, moderated by the panel moderator.",broadening participation in computing | computing education | international collaboration | K-12 education | public private partnerships,0,0,,,,undefined,

However, the sleeve's designer did not have this promotion in mind. Instead, he deliberately muddled the message it originally conveyed in a typical post-punk act of artistic sabotage. In reconstructing the historical events associated with this subversive effort, this essay explores how, after its adoption as an imaging device utilized in radio astronomy, the stacked plot gave representation to the diplomacy agendas of two distinct groups. The post-punk reworking of the stacked plot exemplified the ambition of this artistic movement to attack the images associated with social conventions and norms by amplifying their 'semantic noise', and, in so doing, seeking to negotiate a social space for those sharing these subversive goals. Conversely, radio astronomers used the stacked plot to display the presence of interfering radio transmitters in the frequencies exclusively allocated to astronomical research, thus advocating the removal of this electronic noise in the context of international telecommunication negotiations. The article thus shows how the representation of different types of noise through similar images shaped contrasting ambitions in the separate domains of science diplomacy and everyday diplomacy.",,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,IUAC,undefined,Inter-University Accelerator Centre

During the Cold War, there was a wide exchange and even confrontation between the East and West camps and the major powers in many scientific fields. After 1949, The People’s Republic of China initiated an active stage of learning from the Soviet Union, and the creation of Chinese science was supported by the Soviet scientific community. This influence was particularly noticeable in the field of Chinese biology, especially zoology. A large number of Soviet scientists came to China to impart their knowledge, and many classic Soviet scientific works were translated into Chinese. In the 1950s, Chinese scientists published a large number of translations and descriptions of works by T. D. Lysenko and I. V. Michurin in journalsб such as Bulletin of Biology and other periodicals, which laid the foundation for Michurin’s teachings in Chinese biology and zoology. In 1953, Indian Prime Minister Nehru gifted an elephant to Chinese children, but due to the lack of skills and experience in keeping elephants, Beijing approved the creation of courses for training personnel in animal care and invited the director of the Moscow Zoo I. P. Sosnovskii to give lectures in Beijing and Shanghai to train Chinese specialists. China systematically embraced the Soviet system of knowledge in the areas of animal breeding and cultivation, and shaping of zoo functions.

We find that from a science diplomacy and multi-level governance perspective, the responsibilities and capabilities of emergent actors of cross-level governance are also important, leading to more attention being paid to changes in the role of national authorities, away from passive leadership to cross-cutting coalitions supported by the salient features of science diplomacy, and redefining dominant discursive approaches that have framed plastics waste. Points for practitioners: As a result of the cost and limitations of the current international mechanisms, there is currently no incentive for individual countries to take action against marine plastic pollution. Science diplomacy and multi-level governance can contribute to international cooperation, foreign policy and national strategies.

IEA is resource intensive, requiring the engagement of personnel, experts from many disciplines, public and private institutions, and including issues of technology, infrastructure, capacity building, etc. Stakeholders such as policy-makers and scientists in influential decision-making roles often determine the level of investment when committing to an IEA. It is thus critical to understand how these specific stakeholders understand and perceive IEA, as well as their motivations for engagement. We interviewed government officials, science managers and scientists whose decisions are critical for mobilizing resources (time, expertise and funding) in support of ecosystem based management (and potentially IEA) in the Atlantic Ocean. The interviews aimed at documenting their perceptions of IEA, and their motivations to engage in the process. Our results show that most of these research and policy stakeholders are generally unaware of, or have misconceptions about IEA concepts. Those who expressed awareness of IEA considered IEA as unfit to address most policy and managerial goals. We propose that the IEA process could be improved by promoting inclusivity and applying ocean science diplomacy. We see that these two aspects (inclusivity and science diplomacy) can help research and policy stakeholders understand the true meaning of IEA through negotiating, and by strengthening and diversifying the involvement of international stakeholders. We advocate that the scoping phase of an IEA is of critical importance and should be core to the whole process. It is during the scoping phase that stakeholders are identified and engaged. With their involvement, there is a need to make their interests visible and respected. During the scoping phase, a safe and open space needs to be secured, so these interests can be negotiated and mutual understanding on concepts, roles in the process and the possible outcomes are achieved.

The authors have identified the main reasons – scientific and geopolitical – for the use of the ASD in the region by these two countries, as well as by key state and non-state actors involved in its coordination and implementation. The ASD priorities for both countries include climate change implications, environmental problems, oceanography, geophysics, glaciology, permafrost, Arctic flora and fauna, conservation of biodiversity, Arctic shipping and transport infrastructure, rational use of Arctic mineral and biological resources, local communities, indigenous peoples, integration of traditional knowledge into science, and so on. Based on the analysis, it was found that both the USA and Canada recognize the important role of the Arctic Science Diplomacy in the successful implementation of their Arctic strategy and consider this kind of “non-traditional” public diplomacy to be a rather significant resource of their policy in the Far North. The Canadian ASD has to a greater extent an internal rather than an external orientation, while the U.S. ASD basically serves as an instrument of promotion of American national interests in the region. However, the United States pay less attention to the Arctic Science Diplomacy than Canada. The American ASD infrastructure (including the research centers and polar stations network as well as the research vessel fleet) is less developed than the Canadian one. In addition, in the U.S. strategic documents on the Arctic, unlike Canadian strategies, the coercive component is most clearly traced, which makes the United States a less attractive international partner and imposes certain restrictions on the participation of American ASD actors in Arctic cooperation. Moreover, the United States is very suspicious of the ASD of those regional “players” whom they have listed as unfriendly states (including Russia and China), which also serves as an obstacle to the development of Washington’s scientific cooperation with international partners in the Far North.",Arctic | Canada | international relations | science | science diplomacy | USA,0,0,,,,22-28-01287,

The Mongol Empire held sway over much of Eurasia and thus participated in diplomatic activity within and outside of Mongol domains. Scientists and intellectuals routinely headed diplomatic embassies sent and received by the Mongol Empire. Diplomats were valued for their knowledge and skills and served as interlocutors and translators for the Mongol Khans. These scientist-diplomats were key figures in the court and were essential in facilitating exchanges, building connections and fostering relations. As polyglots and polymaths they were able to operate in a multi-cultural environment. They were part of the complex framework of the Mongol Empire that brought to bear a kind of Eurasian development model that relied on expertise, knowledge and resources that could be utilised across the empire. Set within this context, the paper describes the creation of a politico-science complex in Mongol Eurasia with a special emphasis on the relationship between the Mongol Khans and their partners, chief among them were scientists and intellectuals.

However, despite the impediments of the Soviet system, Central Asian science's cooperation with the outside world has continued. In virtue of being of Asian origin and Muslim and having profound knowledge and understanding of the language and civilizational processes of the East, Central Asian people had a special place in Soviet foreign policy. The Central Asians attracted the sympathy of the peoples of the East, which granted them access to their scientific and diplomatic connections. The paper examines how Central Asians used understanding of and ties to the East in diplomacy, for diplomacy, and with diplomacy. First, the paper unpacks the institutional and individual potential of Soviet Central Asian diplomacy and explains how it was used as a tool for Soviet strategy. The paper then examines Oriental studies as a knowledge basis that enabled improved and more in-depth Soviet diplomacy in the East given the pervasive and basic legacy of Oriental studies in studying the East. Further, Soviet involvement in UNESCO programmes in Asia provides insight into how Soviet policy used its soft power through international organisations.

The main protagonists of the story are Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, the developers of the IPV and oral poliovirus vaccine. This paper revisits the story of polio vaccine development from a Soviet perspective, focusing on an international collaboration initiated by Soviet scientists who crossed the Iron Curtain and visited the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1955, Mikhail Chumakov, the head of the newly established Soviet Institute of Poliomyelitis, led a small group of Soviet medical scientists to the United States to learn about the Salk polio vaccine. The delegation gained more than just knowledge about American polio vaccine development, but they also established a regular channel for communication and collaboration between Soviet and American medical scientists that led to the national immunization program against polio in the USSR. The vaccine used for the Soviet mass immunization campaign was the Sabin live-attenuated polio vaccine that would ultimately be chosen as the weapon for global polio eradication. This paper suggests that the Soviet science diplomacy in the field of global medicine was shaped by the Soviet scientists’ experience of cooperating with their American counterparts for the Soviet polio vaccination campaign. In other words, the experience of international collaboration on the polio vaccination campaign influenced Soviet science diplomacy in the Cold War era.",Albert Sabin | Cold War | East-West collaboration | global health | health diplomacy | Mikhail Chumakov | poliomyelitis | Soviet science diplomacy,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,MOE,NRF-2019S1A2A2032519,Ministry of Education

Instead, Science Diplomacy on Display follows mobile atomic exhibitions as they move across national borders and around the world, functioning as spaces for diplomatic encounters. Exhibitions play a vital role not only in the production of knowledge and the formation of political worldviews but also as assets in diplomatic negotiations and as promoters of a new worldview in which nuclear stands at the centre. They are powerful iconic diplomatic devices, that is systems of representations that capture the diplomatic processes in action and make the nitty-gritty details of international relations visible.

Others criticise the taxonomy for painting the picture of compliant scientists who would discard their academic ideals to support foreign policy objectives. Against the backdrop of these two points of criticism, this study investigates if scientists are willing to support political objectives through science collaborations. It also examines under which conditions science for diplomacy is effective. Using the epistemic community approach, expert interviews and a case study, the study argues that science for diplomacy is effective if it is promoted by a close-knit epistemic community and shows that scientists oppose the instrumentalisation of scientific collaboration for political purposes.",epistemic community | marine conservation | science collaboration | science diplomacy | science for diplomacy | US-Cuban relations | US-Iranian relations,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

By analysing key policy documents over the last 15 years, this study identifies and explains the development of an adaptation policy. Most recently, a bureaucratic process set in motion by Russia’s ratification of the Paris Agreement produced a set of policy documents addressing adaptation to negative climate impacts. These documents employed a bureaucratic-administrative approach, and the effectiveness of expected measures can be questioned. From 2020, a deeper reassessment of climate challenges has evolved, triggered by radical climate changes observed in the Russian Arctic, but also by developments in international climate policies and the energy transition. Economic adaptation to these trends has come to the forefront, raising questions of the need for structural change in the Russian economy. Opposition to reform remains strong, but the scope for discussion of possible pathways has widened considerably. Further development of low-carbon policies in Russia are contingent on international cooperation and integration of Russia in the world economy. The isolation of Russia, following the invasion of Ukraine, will make it difficult to influence Russian climate policies. Key policy insights: Unlike the West, Russian climate policy has focused on adaptation, rather than mitigation. But policies have been weak, and adaptation not mainstreamed. Detailed recommendations for adaptation to climate change impacts adopted in 2021 signalled higher political attention, but framed adaptation largely as a technical task. Since 2020, a broader climate change and adaptation discourse entered Russian politics where adaptation to international climate policies and the energy transition is at the centre. Debate on Russia’s role in the changing energy market had started, but the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing international isolation of Russia is likely to reduce Russia’s capacity and incentives to carry out low-carbon policies. Western countries will have to consider how they can provide climate policy incentives to Russia in the new international situation, as Russia will remain essential for the success of the climate regime.

Here, we describe the process of these events (workshops, conference sessions, and public dialogues), the findings, and the outcomes that have followed. Prior to this focused engagement, United States and Greenland scientists typically pursued their research independently. Since the engagement, more researchers from both countries have successfully partnered to obtain funding for collaborative research. Furthermore, development of a bilateral collaboration network is underway. The focused approach on bilateral engagement also proved essential for maintaining research and other activities during the global pandemic. When United States researchers were prevented from entering Greenland, their Greenland partners were able to continue the fieldwork, ensuring that progress was not lost.

In recent years, there has been a flurry of prominent international scientific academies and intergovernmental organizations calling for engagement with different publics on social, ethical, and regulatory issues related to neuroscience and neurotechnology advances. Neuroscientific activities and outputs are value-laden; they reflect the cultural, ethical, and political values that are prioritized in different societies at a given time and impact a variety of publics beyond the laboratory. The focus on engagement in neuroscience recognizes the breadth and significance of current neuroscience research whilst acknowledging the need for a neuroethical approach that explores the epistemic and moral values influencing the neuroscientific agenda. The field of neuroethics is characterized by its focus on the social, legal, and philosophical implications of neuroscience including its impact on cultural assumptions about the cognitive experience, identity, consciousness, and decision-making. Here, we outline a proposal for neuroethics engagement that reflects an enhanced and evolving understanding of public engagement with neuroethical issues to create opportunities to share ideation, decision-making, and collaboration in neuroscience endeavors for the benefit of society.

This article particularly focuses attention on how the legacy of Bernalism has fostered the emergence of two different types of science diplomacy. On the one hand, Bernalism has influenced the goals of organizations such as UNESCO and the World Peace Council, which are forms of science diplomacy I would term from above. On the other hand, Bernalism has also been at the origin of radical scientific movements that I propose to interpret as forms of scientific diplomacy from below. These have, in fact, played a cardinal role not only in raising public awareness of the social and political roles of science, but also in the more direct participation of scientists in defining the political objectives of their research activity.

While both of these narratives are present in the Arctic states' strategies, most of them tend to support collaborative efforts. Science diplomacy (SD) is a useful mechanism in this regard as it helps states overcome potential disagreements and can stimulate cooperation in other areas. Given the growing concerns about global risks, SD is more important now than ever before. In our study, we identify and focus on three indicators for potential SD in the Arctic strategies: i) scientific infrastructure; ii) membership in intergovernmental/interparliamentary and scientific/education organisations and networks and iii) specific areas of scientific cooperation. Considering the intensive scientific activity in the region, it is not surprising that the strategies discuss different forms of research and scientific cooperation, although none explicitly use the term science diplomacy. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals the Arctic states do apply the SD concept in their strategies and use three types of diplomacy - science in diplomacy, science for diplomacy or diplomacy for science - in the three indicators.",Arctic states | Arctic strategies | Foreign policy | Research cooperation | Science diplomacy,2,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,MUNI/G/1540/2019,Nordisk Ministerråd

Yet underlying some of these well-intended and sometimes successful initiatives is a one-sided understanding of SD. The most recent literature takes a more differentiated approach towards the means and ends of SD. It shows that international scientific interaction is shaped by the twofold logic of competition and collaboration. Instruments of SD can be meant to serve national interests, collective regional goals or global agendas. The present paper disentangles these confounding discourses of collaboration and competition based on a conceptually enhanced SD framework. It analyses Arctic strategies and two cases of Arctic SD, the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation and research activities on Svalbard, to reveal the mechanisms of collaboration and competition in the sphere of international science in relation to security, environment and economy.

Both countries have promoted research & innovation in the areas of biotechnology through research grants, exchange of scholars, visits of Indian scholars to Australian institutions, etc. Indo-Australian Biotechnology Fund for Collaborative Research Projects was established under the Indo-Australia innovations partnership. Research relating to Biotechnology in the fields of agriculture, food security, biomedical devices and implants, and marine sciences has been of prime focus in the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund (AISRF). Research promotion in biological systems is one of the crucial areas in recent initiatives taken by both countries in advancing critical and emerging technologies. Today Indian agriculture & allied sectors face numerous challenges from climate change, drought, declining water levels, and substantial losses to crop pests, including insects, rodents, nematodes, fungal pathogens, bacteria, viruses, etc. Abiotic stresses like drought, extreme temperatures, salinity, and mineral toxicity negatively impact the growth of crops. New challenges, therefore, require energizing science diplomacy for greater collaboration with nations, which have developed scientific cultures and advanced systems of facilitating and nurturing innovations in the field of biotechnology and agriculture sciences. In the broader policy framework of science diplomacy, science & technology cooperation, including new technology for the agriculture sector, has been a crucial element of Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policy. In addition to bilateral initiatives, the scope for India-Australia science & technology cooperation through multilateral formats such as G20 and Quad should be explored. In this context, the article analyses the India-Australia cooperation in biotechnology and how it can be further expanded in addressing new areas.

In particular, we first reveal how cultural diplomacy was used with the purpose of gaining international recognition and terminating starvation in the 1920s. Afterwards, we examine the practice of increasing the number of Soviet friends and proponents in the 1930s through friendship societies and cultural diplomacy tools. Additionally, the role of public diplomacy in WWII as anti-fascism resistance committees, friendship societies and international broadcasting cooperation of allied nations, including within the sphere of anti-Nazi disinformation, is discovered. Following this, the methods of Soviet public diplomacy during the Cold war confrontation are analysed through people-to-people diplomacy mechanisms, science diplomacy and development assistance to the ""non-alignment"" countries. Lastly, the target audience of Soviet public diplomacy is defined, along with the analysis of the main Soviet public diplomacy institutions under the lens of their activities. The article states that the Soviet Union had a strong centralized public diplomacy system aimed at the needs of foreign policy. During the Cold war, huge amounts of money were spent on the battle of two ideologies. Dogmatism, the impossibility of critical thinking within the framework of the existing system, closed borders did not contribute to the formation of a favorable image of the country.

The cooperation under the SSC does not substitute but complements North–South development cooperation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Local government participates in national science diplomacy in four primary ways: twinned cities, intercity international organizations, foreign direct exchanges between cities, and city collaboration platforms. The representative event of polar science diplomacy was the conclusion of the Antarctic Treaty by 12 participating countries, which included the United States of America and the Soviet Union, during the International Geophysical Year. Subsequently, starting from nothing, China has achieved historic advances in its polar activities on small–large through polar science diplomacy. Shanghai is a gateway city via which China communicates with the Arctic and Antarctic, and it has been promoting China’s polar science diplomacy since the 1980s. The status of Shanghai as a national polar gateway city developed during the 1980s–1990s, and its foreign direct exchanges comprised mainly personnel visits. Since the beginning of 21st century, Shanghai has become an Asian polar gateway city and the forms of foreign direct exchanges have become increasingly diverse. During this transformative process, Shanghai experienced problems concerning the lack of top-level design, single form of participation and low level of foreign direct exchanges. Taking the opportunity presented by the “Fourteenth Five-Year Plan” and the preparation for the “Fifth International Polar Year”, Shanghai could further promote China’s polar science diplomacy through measures such as establishing polar twinned cities and building polar city collaboration platforms.",China | polar regions | science diplomacy | Shanghai,0,0,,,,undefined,

Not even diplomacy could escape change when Covid-19 hit the world in January 2020. Old approaches that have been in place for decades, even centuries, changed drastically, and diplomacy could not expect to continue as if nothing had happened. Approach to and application and operation of diplomacy has essentially been affected. In the era after Covid-19, countries and diplomats will still have to pay attention to these variables and will hardly be able to return to a previous era. Furthermore, domestic politics play an important role when considering strategic foreign policy decisions due to the threats that are expected or are already being carried out in connection with national security issues. Decisions on foreign affairs must therefore be evaluated in a certain domestic context because they develop mainly within national borders. In recent decades, the link between the two has become closer. The concepts of national interest, national security, domestic politics, and foreign policy have now become even more intertwined. Consequently, the question arises involuntarily: how are diplomats prepared and trained for this new world. Nowadays, diplomats are expected to be international advisers. Geopolitical views and applications have become more and more important, and the world is more interconnected than ever before. Understanding the global system is an inevitable requirement. The era requires people who can make difficult decisions and who will not worry about fine protocol rules being strictly enforced and adhered to anymore. These international advisers are now more than ever involved and instrumental in decision-making processes of peace and national security. This interdisciplinary role that these advisers must play is a challenging one that requires skilful dynamics. Contemporary diplomacy is changing at an unprecedented pace and is characterised by new role players, new issues, and new responsibilities. Multilateralism, which was the key to diplomacy since World War II has only gained momentum in the last 30 years, and with Covid-19, the importance of multilateral diplomacy was reaffirmed. In the span of two years, Covid-19 has revealed itself as a great equaliser, proving how interdependent the whole world really is. Covid-19 has unequivocally proved that the future of diplomacy is multilaterally driven. In addition, Covid-19 prevents personal contact and meetings, but foreign policymakers have been forced to adapt to a new digital norm. That digital revolution not only makes a wealth of information available, but also increases the speed at which decisions must be made. Diplomats similarly benefit from gathering and sharing knowledge, and this knowledge is made available at an unprecedented rate and needs to be managed. Knowledge management is the efficient handling of information and resources within a particular organisation. Knowledge diplomacy and a knowledge management system are both important because they increase the effectiveness of an institution's decision-making ability and ensure that all employees have access to overall expertise within the organisation. Knowledge management is consequently the conscious process of defining, structuring, retaining, and sharing knowledge and experience of employees within an organisation. The term knowledge diplomacy is becoming more and more popular and is used in different ways. Knowledge diplomacy, therefore, understands the role that international higher education, research, and innovation can play in strengthening relations between states. The impact of technology on the practice of diplomacy in the time of Covid-19 also inevitably emphasised the growing importance of conducting diplomacy digitally. Diplomats need to take a proactive approach to digitisation and acquire the skills needed to further promote domestic diplomacy through digital platforms as an important new component of future public diplomacy. The fight against the emergence of digital disinformation must, due to the nature of the decidedly negative implications of fake news, also receive pertinent attention. The subject of cyber security is most important and may not be ignored. Science diplomacy has become increasingly important. Another important aspect that diplomats should actively consider is how corporations continue to grow in their ability to practise public diplomacy. States are no longer the only international role players in the ever-growing diplomatic scene. Therefore, in order not to run the risk of becoming an endangered activity - which may become increasingly irrelevant because of increasing technological advances - diplomatic representation in the digital age must be intensified in order to increase diplomatic engagement and become a critical tool in an era of complex interdependence and globalisation. The number of role players involved in foreign affairs and diplomacy in one way or another has increased tremendously in recent decades. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more the world changes, and the challenge for diplomats is to manage these changes. The role of China and Russia in following their own world vision is an aspect of growing importance and demands constant vigilance.","corporate diplomacy | Covid-19 | digital diplomacy | digital technology | domestic policies | foreign affairs | geopolitical relations | knowledge diplomacy | knowledge management | multilateral diplomacy, science diplomacy",0,0,,,,undefined,

Coordination across sectors is now more critical than ever, not only because of the expanding human footprint but also because of climate change impacts on the ocean. Sustainable global ocean use can support the Blue Economy while also reversing negative climate impacts on the ocean. Advancements in science and technology, along with increasing momentum on global commitments to sound ocean governance, and science diplomacy internationally can support sustainable ocean use with accurate and timely information about the status and trends in the ocean's ecosystem services (benefits) to society.

The authors argue that diplomatic practices used to support the said cooperation are conducted at two levels. The macro-level features intergovernmental and interstate cooperation, such as making international agreements on scientific and technical cooperation, while at the micro-level individual scholars or scientific groups are supported by diplomats in their relations with foreign partners. However, there are issues jeopardizing cooperation between diplomats and scientists, and in order to gain insight into the nature of these problems and suggest ways to rectify the situation and so alleviate the struggle of both sides, the authors have conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with representatives of Russian-speaking academia and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The scientists interviewed have reported legal issues, as well as a lack of consular and visa information, as factors negatively affecting their decision to go abroad for working purposes; the so-called research diaspora is poorly consolidated, subverting efforts to coordinate Russian-speaking researchers outside Russia. The diplomats expressed regret over the absence of formal definitions for such terms as ‘researcher’ and ‘research diaspora’ which effectively hinders the identification of those eligible for diplomatic and consular support within the ‘diplomacy for science’ framework. The support itself is provided unevenly across Russian diplomatic establishments abroad, being dependent on the staffing situation and the Ambassador’s as well as senior diplomats’ personal interest in the matter. At the same time, both scholars and diplomats indicated difficulties in communicating with each other, caused by among other reasons a sense of mutual distrust. Based on the empirical data collected and analyzed, the authors have formulated a number of recommendations for decision-makers to bolster the country’s science diplomacy effort. To enhance consular and visa support, it is suggested that travel for the purposes of scientific exchange be designated as an independent visa category and ‘Scientist IDs’ introduced (similarly to ‘Fan IDs’). To engage more with the research diaspora, it is advisable to define what categories of researchers comprise the said group and offer them eased rules of entry and naturalization. Restarting the existing Internet resources related to scientific exchange alongside launching a specialized online platform integrating such sources would serve to improve the information coverage of Russian science diplomacy.",digital diplomacy | diplomacy for science | international scientific and technical cooperation | overseas compatriots | research diaspora | science diplomacy | scientific policy,0,0,,,,undefined,

Despite the initial skepticism, the constructive approach, on the one hand, of Russian historians, and, on the other hand, of their German, Austrian, Polish and Lithuanian colleagues, has made it possible in recent years to publish a number of joint books for secondary school teachers on the most problematic and topical issues of history. The author calls for more active use of the experience of the Cold War, when international scientific expert groups were formed, which jointly searched for ways to alleviate international tension and exit from the acute phase of the Cold War. The publication of archival documents also plays an important role in realizing the goals of science diplomacy. In general, in recent years, despite the aggravation of the international situation, Russian historians have gained considerable experience in international cooperation, the best confirmation of which was the holding of the first ever World Congress of School History Teachers in Moscow in 2021, and in September 2022 in St. Petersburg - conferences with the participation of authors of school textbooks from around the world.",bilateral commissions of historians | Russia | Science diplomacy | textbooks | World Congress of School History Teachers,0,0,,,,undefined,

Russia can play a special role in this, having sufficient experience in organizing major scientific events and rich human resources to formulate the scientific agenda. Over the past two years, several events have taken place in Russia at once, in which, based on the principles of science diplomacy, a new impetus was given to the modernization of school curricula in history and methods of teaching history, taking into account the study of international experience. Based on the results of the international conference “History Textbook for the Future. A New Look”, with the participation of the author of history textbooks from around the world, an important decision was made to create an international working group, which at the first stage will develop methodological recommendations for secondary school teachers around the world on teaching specific topics from world history.

The process of informing about Knorozov’s breakthrough in the study of Maya hieroglyphs began in the summer of 1952 in “Liter-aturnaya gazeta”, even before the official publication of his article. In response, “The New York Times” published two comments in which the name of the young Russian scholar was mentioned for the first time. Particular interest was expressed in Mexico, where all major newspapers reacted to the news from USSR. This motivated the Soviet embassy to publish an abbreviated Spanish translation of Knorozov’s article in their bulletin in 1953. This publication, in turn, contributed to the spread of information both among a wider audience and among the academic com-munity. After the defense of Knorozov’s dissertation, when he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Sciences (Habil-itation), a new promotion campaign started. His report on the decipherment with an English translation was distribut-ed to the participants of the 10th Congress of Historical Sciences in Rome (1955), and later he presented his discover-ies at the 32nd International Congress of Americanists in Copenhagen, which caused a wide international responce. Publications in the Soviet public journals such as “Sovietsky Soyuz” (Soviet Union) and “Novoe Vremy a” (The New Times) played a special role. They paid less attention to the ideological confrontation and highlighted the achievements of Soviet historical science.

This chapter outlines the early development of the PCSWA, its Continuing Committee (its de facto leadership), and the important role of the Secretary General. It highlights the dissenting roots of Pugwash in the West, its narratives about the shared language of science, its demonstrative commitment to political neutrality, and its pioneering role in informal ‘Track II’ diplomacy.

There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and cooperation with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia. This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stakeholders and key forms of Russia’s ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the implementation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD. These platforms include both national platforms (the international forum “The Arctic: The Territory of Dialogue” and “The Arctic: Present and Future”) and the active use of international platforms (“Arctic Frontiers,” “Polar Circle,” and “Arctic Science Summit Week”) and organizations such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS).",Arctic | Arctic council | Arctic strategies | Foreign policy | Public diplomacy | Science diplomacy,1,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,RSF,22-28-01287,Russian Science Foundation

However, despite its ambition and recent success in meeting most 2020 goals, the EU does not have an easy schedule to progress on its climate and energy targets for 2030. Recognizing the transition, one of the scientific excellences European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) published the first environmental report in the beginning of 2020. Through a wide range of environmental activities and clearly disseminated targets, this organisation actually brought to the table a discourse on how scientific organisation can be part of EU Green Deal actions and how to perform research within the scope of the environmental context. This article focuses on two concepts to contribute to larger discussions in both the research and governance communities, how researchers should conduct their science, and what respective responsibilities of researchers, their institutes, have in terms of European environmental policy. Literature was reviewed to find a theoretical approach to the environment, responsible innovation and science diplomacy. The research was developed through literature study to identify and describe the respective indicators as well as through an analysis of secondary sources whereby a previous attempt to collect and analyse other sources had been conducted by scholars in respect to the relationship between innovation and the environment.",Environmental policy | European Organisation for Nuclear Research | responsible innovation | science diplomacy,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

We determine the scope of these countries’ participation and the variables that intervene. Results show that funding received by LAC organizations decreased significantly from the 7th to the 8th FP due to an increase in projects with no EU monetary contribution. Co-authoring with European partners or by domestic authors in publications issued from these projects by LAC researchers represented an average 12% of all publications in both FPs, and it was marginal in some projects and decisive in others, depending on the topic of research. We conclude that the participation of these countries due to EU science diplomacy actions was important in the 7th FP and less so in H2020 and that this involvement has become less dependent on their being targeted as a region, or by Spain’s brokerage as coordinator.",European Union | H2020 | Latin America | Research and Innovation Framework Programme | Science Diplomacy,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,H2020,undefined,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

SDMs can identify the potential for species' and community range shifts under climate change, and thus can inspire, inform, and guide complex and adaptive conservation management planning efforts such as collaborative transboundary conservation frameworks. However, SDMs are rarely developed collaboratively, which would be ideal for conservation applications of such models. Further, SDMs that are applied to conservation often do not follow best practices of the field, which are particularly important for applications in climate change contexts for which model extrapolation into potentially novel climates is necessary. Thus, while there is substantial promise, particularly among machine-learning based SDM approaches, there are also many pitfalls to consider when applying SDMs to conservation, and especially in the context of transboundary management under climate change. Here, we summarize these pitfalls and the key steps to mitigate them and maximize the promise of applying SDMs to facilitate transboundary conservation planning under climate change. We argue that conservation modeling capacity must be elevated among practitioners such that they can easily implement best practices when using SDMs, especially regarding: 1) avoiding model overcomplexity, 2) addressing input data bias, and 3) accounting for uncertainty in model extrapolations and projections. While our discussion centers mainly on the pitfalls and opportunities of applying the most popular correlative SDM algorithm, Maxent, our suggestions can also be generalized to a range of other SDM tools. Overall, improved training in, tools for, and implementation of best practices in biogeographic models such as SDMs hold great promise to facilitate and help guide complex, transboundary collaborations for long-term planning of conservation under climate change.",collaboration | conservation biogeography | conservation planning | cross-border conservation | ecological niche modeling | science diplomacy | stakeholder engagement,7,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,VNU-HUS,undefined,"University of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi"

Using a reflexive content analytic approach, this study sheds light on some of these questions, underscoring the disconnect between science, policymaking, and society. Global health funding approaches; politicization of the pandemic, including political blame gaming; mistrust of government and other institutions; and a lack of robust accountability measures are some of the pandemic response obstacles. However, COVID-19 has also presented an opportunity for a collaboration that may potentially solidify global solidarity. A pandemic response built on strategic global health diplomacy, vaccine diplomacy, and science diplomacy can spur both political and economic benefits, advancing development, health security, and justice. The virus thrives and flourishes in face of political divisions and lack of cooperation.

These engagements, which can be framed as Science Diplomacy (SD) efforts, were motivated by the Turkish government’s perception that Turkey needs to become more integrated with the European countries, and must stay abreast of the science and technology developments or risk falling behind other EU candidate countries. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore how the emerging concept of SD helps explain transformations and changes in Turkish Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policies since 2000, with a special focus on engagements with the EU’s science and research programs and European organizations, and subsequently filling a gap in related literature. Europeanization and qualitative content analysis are used as theoretical framework and methodology, respectively, to analyze these engagements. The key findings and conclusions point out that Turkey’s efforts to harmonize its science and technology policies with the EU’s has paved the way for new funding mechanisms and its participation in Horizon 2020 as an associated country. In addition, using Science and Technology (S&T) cooperation as a soft power has strengthened the public diplomacy of Turkey with the European countries. As a result, increased involvement in STI partnerships with the European countries could help Turkey open new venues for developing its SD. However, despite the mutual economic and political benefit gained through scientific interactions, Turkey is still not using science as a diplomacy tool as effectively as it might to augment its foreign policy. It should be noted that research is one of the very few areas where the relations Turkey and the EU are still cooperating, regardless of growing tensions between the two parties. Thus, Framework Programs and other scientific projects that Turkey has participated in can provide founding experiences of Turkish SD with the EU, and may help Turkey open new venues for developing its SD.

Though some Russian analysts and practitioners were skeptical about the usefulness of such a mechanism during the 1980s and 1990s, Russia has become an active contributor to the progress of the Arctic Council (AC). Russia's first term as chair during 2004-2006 led to the creation of the Arctic Contaminants Action Program as an Arctic Council Working Group. Since then, Russia has served as co-lead of the Task Forces developing the terms of the 2011 agreement on search and rescue, the 2013 agreement on marine oil spill preparedness and response, and the 2017 agreement on enhancing international scientific cooperation. Russia also has participated actively in the creation of related bodies including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum and the Arctic Economic Council whose chairmanships rotate together with the chairmanship of the AC. Now, far-reaching changes in the broader setting are posing growing challenges to the effectiveness of these institutional arrangements. The impacts of climate change in the high latitudes have increased dramatically; the pace of the extraction and shipment of Arctic natural resources has accelerated sharply; great-power politics have returned to the Arctic foregrounding concerns regarding military security. Together, these developments make it clear that a policy of business as usual will not suffice to ensure that the AC remains an important high-level forum for addressing Arctic issues in a global context. The programme Russia has developed for its 2021-2023 chairmanship of the council is ambitious; it proposes a sizeable suite of constructive activities. In this article, however, we go a step further to explore opportunities to adapt the Arctic governance system to the conditions prevailing in the 2020s. We focus on options relating to (i) the AC's constitutive arrangements, (ii) links between the council and related governance mechanisms, (iii) the role of science diplomacy, and (iv) the treatment of issues involving military security. We conclude with a discussion of the prospect of organising a heads of state/government meeting during the Russian chairmanship as a means of setting the Arctic governance system on a constructive path for the 2020s.",Agenda setting | Constitutive arrangements | Intergovernmental organisations | Military security | Science diplomacy,1,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,NSF,1660449,National Science Foundation

Moscow will probably try to make the Arctic Council's budget, including specific project budgets, more transparent and systemized. The Russian presidency aims to make the role of permanent participants and observers in the Council's activities more visible. At the same time, Moscow will avoid its former claims to transform the Council from an intergovernmental forum to a full-fledged international organization and bring military security problematique to the Council's agenda.

UIB is also among the most vulnerable water towers in the world vis-a-vis climate as well as a host of environmental and socio-economic changes. The paucity of ground observations and their associated unknowns make it imperative to study and highlight the grey areas for attention and action by policy planners and basin government and management at different levels in order to improve the management and the governance structures for better water resource management. As this river basin is shared between countries, enhanced co-creation of knowledge can provide greater understanding of the challenges to stakeholders so that they can make better decisions regarding the development of the region. With this in view, the UIB network, comprising four national chapters (Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan) linked strategically at regional level, was conceived to provide better understanding of the critical issues associated with the UIB. The network strives for a resilient and empowered UIB region through science-based regional cooperation, which promotes coordination and collaboration among organizations working in the UIB to ensure improved understanding of present and future water availability, demand and hazards and to develop gender sensitive solutions for all stakeholders. The special issue is one of such efforts from the network in knowledge generation, exchange, and dissemination to contribute towards an enhanced understanding of climate change impacts in the Indus. The paper presents a time-wise evolution of the network to highlight the importance of cross boundary knowledge and the relevance of such networks. Such a science-based network can provide important information for science-backed policies for the basin countries. It also details the achievements of the network, lessons learnt from such knowledge networks, and the potential for future contributions to basin countries taking into consideration the transboundary nature of the UIB.",Integrated river basin management | Knowledge network | Regional cooperation | Science diplomacy | Water management policies,5,1,repositoryam,Green,DEZA,undefined,Direktion für Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit

This article traces how the earthquake sciences were constructed as a ‘Japanese science’, giving Japan authority in science diplomacy, what science diplomacy practices scientists engaged in, and the images of Japan they helped to convey internationally. In the late nineteenth century, Japan played a crucial role in establishing seismology as a scientific discipline, which supported claims of Japanese research experience with their highly seismically active environment. Thus, Japanese earthquake specialists were enabled to act on equal terms with their Western counterparts in international networks, and even became regarded as ‘teachers’ of earthquake-proof construction. This image that was built and expanded upon by generations of scientists and maintained regardless of the shifting political climate. Consequently, prewar science diplomacy served to justify ‘civilised’ Japanese colonial rule in East Asia, while postwar earthquake science underlined Japan’s new identity as a peaceful ‘developed’ country and became a crucial part of Japan’s developmental aid programs. Science diplomacy also helped open diplomatic channels for Japan during difficult international conditions and created sustainable networks between seismic countries.","history of the earth sciences | Japanese history | Science diplomacy | transnational history of science, history of Japan-US relations | twentieth century",0,0,,,MEXT,undefined,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology"

Their proposals to include isotope hydrology among the range of IAEA activities sparked debate in the IAEA Scientific Advisory Committee and Board of Governors. At stake was not merely the future support of the technique, but the diplomatic role of the IAEA as a provider of atomic energy to the developing world, the relationship of the IAEA to other international institutions, and the articulation of what ‘peaceful uses of atomic energy’ really meant. In the end, the IAEA opted to render conditional support for the landmark Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation and undertook sponsorship of expert panels that brought together isotope specialists and hydrologists. As the essay shows, the IAEA’s agenda for isotope hydrology was not only a matter of technology, linked to instrumentation and technique.

This response is paradigmatic of how scientific predictions can work as stimuli for science diplomacy activities, and either inflate or deflate these forecasts’ public resonance. Those who elaborated the theory in the early 1980s predicted that the environmental consequences of a future nuclear conflict would have been catastrophic; possibly rendering the earth uninhabitable and leading to the extinction of humankind. This prospect was particularly problematic for the Western defence alliance, since it was difficult to reconcile with the tenets of its nuclear posture, especially after the 1979 Dual Track decision, engendering concerns about the environmental catastrophe that the scientists predicted. Thus, NATO officials refrained from commenting on nuclear winter and its implications for the alliance’s deterrence doctrine for some time in an effort to minimize public criticism. Meanwhile, they progressively removed research on nuclear winter from the set of studies and scientific debates sponsored by NATO in the context of its science initiatives. In essence, NATO officials ‘traded’ the promotion of these problematic studies with that of others more amenable to the alliance’s diplomacy ambitions.",International scientific collaboration | NATO | nuclear age | nuclear winter | public diplomacy | science diplomacy,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,H2020,770523,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

This article challenges the portrayal of ‘science diplomacy’ as a straightforward strategy through the examination of the foreign policy-scientific cooperation nexus in the EU-Southern Mediterranean neighbourhood. Through a policy documents analysis, the article traces the development of the external dimension of the EU’s science policy, i.e. the shaping of the EU’s science policy beyond its borders, and the inclusion of science into its foreign policy agenda in the South Mediterranean. The analysis reveals that the EU’s enthusiasm for ‘science diplomacy’ can be related to the EU’s internal political goals, rather than any significant change in the policy objectives or policy tools. Moreover, a strong cooperation in science and research between the EU and its Mediterranean neighbours was contingent on friendly relations, rather than capable of improving conflicts and tensions. The conclusion suggests to focus on building the practical (civilian) impact of genuine scientific cooperation in the aftermath of an uncritical promotion of ‘science diplomacy’.","EU foreign policy | Euro-Mediterranean | External science policy | Science, technology and innovation | Scientific cooperation | Southern Mediterranean",0,0,,,H2020,2018/16,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

This paper aims to consider the possibilities of using science diplomacy not only as a tool to reduce tensions between countries, but also as a tool for foreign policy influence. Most modern Western researchers believe that the goals of science diplomacy are reduced exclusively to creating an apolitical atmosphere for solving important global problems. When we are considering science diplomacy from a realistic point of view, the concept can be outlined through national interest, pragmatic public administration, gaining influence and maintaining the balance of power. In the study, the author proves that one of the main goals of science diplomacy is to strengthen the influence of the state through the promotion of national science, as a result of which it will be easier for the interested subject of international relations to achieve its foreign policy goals. The tools of science diplomacy can be successfully used by the state to increase its international influence beyond territorial borders, open the way to gaining a greater international status, and legitimize its ambitions. The author believes that the currently existing definitions of science diplomacy do not fully disclose its content. In this regard, the paper attempts to give a new comprehensive definition of the term, taking into account aspects related to its foreign policy influence. Science diplomacy, according to the author, is a deliberate international activity of the state through controlled scientific organizations and foundations in order to strengthen interaction with other countries, provide them with information influence and promote its interests in the international arena. The article concludes that Russia should conceptualize the domestic model of “soft power” taking into account science diplomacy, as well as begin to take practical steps to research technologies of protection from a possible “soft” impact of science by other states.",International relations | Public diplomacy | Science diplomacy | Soft power,1,0,,,RSF,19-78-00047,Russian Science Foundation

However, there continues to be contestation around the concept of science diplomacy, currently framed alternately as a new understanding of diplomacy, part of the global challenges discourse, central to the internationalization of science, and typifying competitive innovation. This contestation is furthered by the involvement of a broad array of policy instruments and actors in science diplomacy. In response, this paper focuses on a single policy instrument, examining eight bilateral and multilateral scientific cooperation agreements led by Canada, India, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Kingdon’s multiple streams framework is employed to explain how the interplay between policy actors, the policy agenda, policy problems, and policy alternatives leads to the creation of science diplomacy policies. Across the cases, all of the current science diplomacy discourses were applicable, holding stronger explanatory power in the problem and policy streams of the policy process while not obviously matching processes seen in the political stream. The findings also identified a gap in the current framing in understanding how geopolitical dynamics impact the creation of science diplomacy policies and how different policy actors negotiate, exploit, or are subject to these forces. By stabilizing one element of the ongoing debates around science diplomacy, the paper contributes a deeper examination of the array of policy actors and their involvement in different stages of the policy process leading to the formation of scientific cooperation agreements as tools of science diplomacy.",Canada | India | Norway | Science diplomacy | scientific collaboration | scientific cooperation agreements | United Kingdom,3,0,,,SSHRC,undefined,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada

The problem of the rise of China and its entry into the ranks of the strongest military powers is also discussed. This article emphasizes the idea that today, when geopolitical and technological threats to strategic stability are becoming increasingly prominent, national security can no longer be limited to maintaining the nuclear balance: it is necessary to strive for scientific and technical parity, which is the only way to achieve military-technological parity. The increasing role of fundamentally new types of conventional high-precision and hypersonic weapons, which are based on scientific achievements, is also noted.

Due to the high cost and risk associated with ocean exploration and monitoring in time and space, vast areas of the oceanic social ecological system remain under-sampled or unknown. Governments have recognized that no single nation can on its own fill these scientific knowledge gaps, and this has led to a number of agreements to support international scientific collaboration and the exchange of information and capacity. This paper reviews current discussions on ocean science diplomacy, i.e., the intersection of science with international ocean affairs. Ocean science is intrinsically connected with diplomacy in supporting negotiations toward a more sustainable future. Diplomacy supports essential aspects of scientific work such as capacity building, technology and information/knowledge exchange, and access and sharing of research platforms. Ocean science diplomacy underlies the work of many intergovernmental organizations that provide scientific guidance, such as the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), and United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). To illustrate how critical science diplomacy is to global ocean affairs, this paper examines examples of the influence of ocean science diplomacy in UNCLOS.

From 1942 to 1946, the United States sent 30 experts in science, technology, medicine, and public health to China. Among them was George Cressey, a geographer of international reputation deeply familiar with the cultural and physical geography of China, who travelled to China as a visiting professor of the Sino–U.S. Cultural Relations Program and a representative of the State Department. However, he was recalled earlier than expected, after only 7 months, because his remarks were thought to be damaging to Sino–U.S. relations. Examining his wartime visit to China within the context of Sino–U.S. relations, this paper uncovers Cressey's diplomatic mission. We illustrate how geography simultaneously became the object of Cressey's research, a tool for the promotion of Sino–U.S. cultural relations, and the theoretical basis for foreign policy proposals. Finally, through a comparison of Cressey's and Joseph Needham's experiences in wartime China, this paper illuminates their different understanding of Chinese culture (including China's society and concept of science and culture), which led to their different approaches to Chinese affairs. It also shows the tension between technical assistance and cultural export in diplomatic relations during wartime.

Organized under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the meeting aimed to be an important stepping-stone in the formation of a new international institutional landscape related to the environment. UNECE, with its history of facilitating international cooperation across the Iron Curtain, provided an optimal platform for such an undertaking. Nonetheless, the Symposium on Problems Relating to Environment was overshadowed by the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, the outcomes of which were instrumentalized by the Soviets to promote their own international policy aims associated with the Brezhnev Doctrine. Soviet authorities considered the environment to be a purely domestic issue and did not show much interest in pursuing international environmental cooperation. The “German Question” at the UN served as a Soviet instrument to pursue Soviet interests and resulted in the downgrading of the Prague meeting and a subsequent boycott of the Stockholm Conference by the entire Eastern Bloc.

Promoters of ocean exploitation in the late 1960s envisaged wonders such as rare mineral extraction and the stationing of divers in underwater habitats from which they would operate seabed machinery not connected to the turbulent surface waters. Their promises coincided with others' fears that nuclear weaponry would be placed on the seabed. Those who lacked the technological capability to extract minerals from the seabed also had concerns that other nations would exploit their resources. Scientific imaginaries caused uncertainty in the international community—especially in the “Global South.” The UN called the “Law of the Sea” conferences to mediate emerging geopolitical tensions caused by these imaginaries of exploitation of ocean resources. These conferences became a site where lawmakers projected futures rather than merely responding to past or present dilemmas. Diplomats' negotiations, with their basis in anticipation of the future uses of science and technology, reveal the role of scientific imaginaries within complex negotiations. Here, we see the impact of the distinction (or blurring) of the real and the imagined on the balance of relations between Global North and South increasing global imbalances of resources and power.

On September 26, amid social and political unrest across the globe, 62 physicists gathered in Geneva to found the European Physical Society. Among these were the official representatives of the national physical societies of 18 countries in both Eastern and Western Europe, who signed the constitution in spite of the political divides of the Cold War. According to the main proponent of the society, Italian physicist Gilberto Bernardini, the success of the initiative was the realization of a dream: the institutional formation of a single community of European physicists, a representation of a culturally unified Europe that he described as a “single highly civilized nation.” The analysis of as yet unexplored archival materials of Bernardini and other protagonists in the establishment of the society has enabled an investigation of the historical development of science diplomacy in two interconnected ways: first, by elucidating how the actors involved, especially those in Western Europe, interpreted their role as diplomats amid particularly turbulent reconfigurations of international political relations; second, by interpreting the attempt to institutionalize transnational scientific networks with the establishment of a non-governmental organization as a tool to influence world political affairs.

Noting the lack of such a dedicated channel for the highly active yet currently fragmented European modelling landscape, we highlight the importance of transparency of modelling capabilities and processes, harmonisation of modelling parameters, disclosure of input and output datasets, interlinkages among models of different geographic granularity, and employment of models that transcend the highly harmonised core of tools used in model inter-comparisons. Finally, drawing from the COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the need to expand the modelling comfort zone, by exploring extreme scenarios, disruptive innovations, and questions that transcend the energy and climate goals across the sustainability spectrum.

In this sense, it is an attractive option for foreign policy strategies throughout the international community. The European Union can use its potential to consolidate its normative power on the international scene while using its strength in research and development to help countries achieve their sustainable goals. If science is properly channelled in domestic policy advice and external relations, its transformative power could lead to a world of better understanding, respect, and collective well-being.

A recent initiative was launched for establishing the South-East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies (SEEIIST), a pan European research infrastructure (RI) which will provide a cutting-edge technology for (a) radiotherapy treatment with accelerated protons and ions and (b) multidisciplinary fundamental research involving accelerated ion beams. To justify the initiative for building the SEEIIST facility for cancer treatment, a study was conducted to estimate the time progress of the cancer incidence and mortality due to cancer in the countries of the SEE region. Methods and materials. The demography and the economic development of the SEE region were studied in relation to their emigration rate (brain drain). Time development of the incidence and mortality were studied for the SEE countries from the data available at Globocan of the IARC@WHO. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries' cancer datasheets from the World Health Organization (WHO). The top ten cancers were presented for the SEE countries and for the region as a whole. Results. From the available data it is evident that the incidence and the mortality, both grow with time in the SEE region, unlike in the developed European countries chosen for reference, where the mortality declines with time. The occurrence of breaking points in curves mortality vs. time is evident for all the analyzed SEE countries. Many of these points coincide with changes in the societal aspects (security, politics and/or economy). Conclusion. The emerging research infrastructure SEEIIST will mitigate the brain drain from SEE, and contribute in overcoming the historical friction in the turbulent Balkan region, offering research opportunities in many fields related to accelerated ions, foster, research, innovation and knowledge transfer, facilitate radiational therapy with particles to the cancer patients of the SEE region, reducing the growing cancer mortality, thereby. SEEIIST will be developed as a strong commitment of the SEE countries' governments and common effort in science diplomacy of the international community. The central research facility will be based in one of the ten SEE countries. In parallel with developing the principal RI, several SEEIIST HUBs and NETWORKs will be developed for different SEE countries in support to the SEEIIST sustainability. To provide sustainability of the SEEIIST RI, a GREEN energy HUB (Green power plant for powering SEEIIST) will be set. Also, an IT HUB (providing big data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence for SEEIIST), Imaging HUB (developing novel imaging solutions for ion therapy for SEEIIST), etc. Furthermore, several combined SEE and western European networks will be established, such as the Training network, Radiobiology Network, Network of Oncologists, Network of Veterinary scientists, with their central coordination offices located in different SEE countries, with the objective to start joint research related primarily to the cancer treatment but also to other research disciplines.",Balkans | Brain Drain | Breaking Points | Cancer epidemiology | Cancer in SEE region | Cancer Incidence | Cancer Mortality | Depopulation | Emigration | Science and diplomacy | SEEIIST,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,30-CE-0838742/00-87,

The uranium was half the amount required for the Japan Research Reactor-3, which reached criticality in 1962 and became Japan’s first domestically developed nuclear reactor. Japan’s request provided an opportunity to reaffirm the IAEA’s raison d’être and set in motion the process of establishing a safeguarding system against the military use of atomic energy. The IAEA Board of Governors deliberated on the issue from October 1958 to April 1959. Although Japan’s request was generally welcomed, it sparked confrontations between countries that accepted IAEA safeguards and those against them. By analysing the IAEA Board’s official records, this paper shows how the negotiations transformed the uranium into a ‘diplomatic object’.",diplomatic object | International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) | Japan Research Reactor-3 (JRR-3) | Nuclear diplomacy | safeguards,1,0,,,KAKEN,JP17K01174,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

The program consisted of lectures, discussions, a teamwork and collaboration exercise, a negotiation workshop, and a Model Arctic Council (MAC)—a simulation of delegates’ work in the Arctic Council. We found that students had strongly positive perceptions of the curriculum and felt that they accrued Arctic-related awareness and skills, while developing enthusiasm for engaging in civic affairs. Students attributed the program’s value to the use of multiple pedagogies, especially simulation, an interdisciplinary environment, and mentorship from and engagement with Arctic Council and other practitioners.",Interdisciplinarity; Model Arctic Council; multiple pedagogies; science diplomacy; simulation,2,0,,,,undefined,

Using the materials of the Foreign Policy Archive of the Russian Empire alongside specialized literature with recourse to the prosopographic method, the author outlines the impact of professional diplomatic background of the above school’s first directors and teachers on their academic and pedagogic activity. As the most prominent and elitist academic institution of the period in question, the Imperial Lyceum initially did not have an explicitly stipulated specialization. Still, many of its alumni upon graduation embraced a career in diplomacy and became civil servants at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Such a choice was to a considerable extent influenced by the professional skills and values transmitted to them by ex-diplomats, who used to be their headmasters and pedagogues. The analysis looks into the particular features, on the one hand, and similarities, on the other hand, of the respective career paths of the latter. It reveals that most of them shared certain values and ethical principles typical for the diplomatic professional community, i.e. patriotism, defense of the State’s national interests and networking. At the same time, a lot of attention was paid to technical training in terms of working with archives, as well as acquiring mastery in foreign languages. The author concludes that in the aggregate these factors shaped a unique educational environment for future diplomats and experts in international relations.",Academic diplomacy | History of Russian diplomacy | Imperial Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum | Professional training of diplomats | Science diplomacy,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

The paper, therefore, presents a new conceptual model for European science diplomacy that can enable more equitable ways of dealing with colonial heritage in relations between EU countries and partners outside Europe. It does so by combining recent literature on science diplomacy, heritage diplomacy, decolonial thinking, and on the concepts of interculturality. We argue that to engage successfully with colonial legacies and heritage, the concept of science diplomacy needs to be developed from a traditional “diffusionist” understanding towards a dialogical approach, which is epismologically open and acknowledges the inequalities in global knowledge production.

His career in science (nuclear) diplomacy also epitomized the shortcomings of efforts to align other countries’ posture on nuclear affairs to U.S. wishes. In particular, the unswerving diplomat increasingly understood that strong-arm tactics to dissuade other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons would not limit proliferation.

Their peoples are also among the first to be widely affected by global changes such as land degradation and climate change. Yet drylands are a source of many social and technical innovations, globally, as well as in Australia. As a major developed dryland nation, Australia has previously played a major role in extending these innovations to the rest of the world. The nation has reaped reputational and commercial benefits through major research and practice contributions to dryland agriculture, water management and governance, remote area services, indigenous partnerships, dryland monitoring systems, and 'desert knowledge' innovation. Australian researchers continue to contribute to various relevant international processes, yet recognition and support for this within Australia has dropped off markedly in recent years. We analyse the Australian government's investment in research and in overseas aid for drylands over the last two decades, and explore trends in government's active involvement in major international processes related to land. These trends are short-sighted, overlooking potential economic benefits for Australian enterprises, and undermining Australia's stance and scientific leadership in dryland systems globally. In this commentary, we argue that it is time for the trends to be reversed, as this is an area of comparative advantage for Australian diplomacy with significant returns on investment for Australia, both direct and indirect, especially when most emerging economies contain substantial drylands. We identify four major pathways to obtaining benefits from science diplomacy, and four interrelated actions within Australia to enable these-to place a higher emphasis on science diplomacy, to re-forge a bipartisan recognition of Australian drylands expertise, to establish a dedicated Dryland Information Hub, and to create a network of relevant science and technology advisors.",comparative advantage | dryland agriculture | research for development | science diplomacy | sustainable development | theory of change,2,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

Although the current literature on SD has explored the relation between science and diplomacy, the question of how individual science projects can effectively aid SD has been left largely unanswered. Drawing on the SD as well as on the place and policy branding literature, a framework for the analysis and conceptualization of branding as a tool for SD and for Public Diplomacy in general is developed. This framework introduces three distinct branding styles: nation branding, policy branding and policy tool branding. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated by the comparison of two cases of branding by nation state policy makers: branding in the field of German transnational education and in the science and knowledge-based Dutch Water Diplomacy. The German case study shows that branding activities relating to ‘German’ SD are fragmented and focus mostly on individual projects, while the use of transnational education as an instrument to advance policy branding or nation branding remains largely underdeveloped. Such a lopsided branding process undermines the effectiveness of branding as an effective SD tool. In contrast, the potential of coordinated branding strategies as a foreign policy tool becomes apparent in the ‘Dutch Delta Approach’. In this centralised and coordinated branding process, activities on all three proposed branding layers were implemented, effectively employing branding to increase the visibility of the Dutch nation state, increase the attraction of its high-tech water management sector as well as to rejuvenate the Netherland’s bi-lateral relations with selected partner countries. Branding, as we argue, should be added to the analysis of contemporary science diplomacy as well as of broader foreign policies, adding to the understanding of SD as an instrument of cross-border communication and global opinion shaping. The paper ends with a discussion of potential limitations of branding, in order to illustrate that branding can be an effective instrument but should not be seen as an international relations panacea.",,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen

SIC are distinct units or satellite institutes, established by governments abroad, operating at the nexus of higher education, research, innovation, and diplomacy. Based on a comparative analysis, this article examines the rise of SIC in Germany and Switzerland. By means of applying a policy instrumentation lens, the career and development of the two SIC is retraced and insights are generated into their political instrumentation. Doing so contributes to unfold the blackbox of what is generally labelled as SD. In-depth interviews and analysis serve as the empirical foundation of this study. Ultimately, the results of this policy instrument study uncover the similarities and differences in SIC development and reveal their political instrumentation over time. It becomes evident that the objectives linked to SIC, and hence SD, are clearly motivated by national needs. Furthermore, notions of SD are reflective of a certain Zeitgeist that is mirrored in the design of an overall, new, policy yet also marks a relabelling of long-existing practices. This study, accordingly, contributes to the knowledge base of SD as it enhances the scholarly understanding of SD instruments in terms of history, actors and political instrumentation while also offering a theoretical anchoring.",,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,SERI,undefined,Singapore Eye Research Institute

Thus, states employ many efforts to conceptualise and implement their science diplomacy strategies. To date, the most advanced in this regard are the rich industrialized countries slowly followed by others, e.g., Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries like Poland. While science diplomacy of selected states is debated among practitioners and analysed empirically, these efforts do not include CEE countries. In this article we present the regulatory, institutional and operational frameworks of Polish science diplomacy. The opinions of SD stakeholders obtained in a series of interviews supplement the findings and give a wider perspective on the challenges Polish science diplomacy is facing. We argue that although a universal model of science diplomacy does not exist, states such as Poland may profit from the experience of more advanced systems. We also claim that Polish science diplomacy is currently significantly conditioned by the domestic political situation. This negatively impacts continuity and coordination in strategic programming and implementation of SD.

Such a requirement is especially challenging in areas where there is no clearly defined jurisdiction. However, in these areas, assigning sovereignty and rights can be achieved through bilateral or multilateral agreements, or with the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tools such as mediation and arbitration. In some cases, states may engage in transboundary marine conservation initiatives to provide an entry point to enable wider collaboration. These processes can also evolve into a form of ‘environmental peacebuilding’ while ideally maintaining ecosystem functioning and resilience as a core goal. Conversely, MPAs and OECMs can also be used to assert maritime sovereignty rights over disputed waters, under the pretext of conserving marine habitats. This paper identifies emerging issues of conflict resolution and their interaction with transboundary marine conservation. While ADR focuses on negotiations and facilitated processes between state representatives (“track one diplomacy”), we also discuss other forms and levels of marine environmental peacebuilding and dispute resolution, particularly those between civil society organizations (“track two diplomacy”). The six case studies presented highlight areas of recent maritime conflict or border disputes in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the West Indian Ocean, the Korean West Sea and the South China Sea. In all cases, high ecological value, vulnerable ecosystems, and the need to conserve ecosystem services provide a shared interest for cooperation despite on-going diplomatic difficulties. The strategies used in these cases are analyzed to determine what lessons might be learned from cross-border collaborative marine initiatives in situations of territorial dispute. The use of ADR tools and their ability to support joint marine initiatives are examined, as well as how such initiatives contribute to formal border negotiations. Other forms of inter-state dialogue and cooperation between local or civil organizations, circumventing formal treaties and negotiations between state leaders (‘track two’) are also investigated. Finally, other influencing factors, including third-party involvement, stakeholder interests, power dynamics, economic context, and socio-cultural aspects, are considered.",alternative dispute resolution | arbitration | marine conservation | marine protected areas | maritime dispute | mediation | science diplomacy | track two diplomacy,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,WCS,15121,Wildlife Conservation Society

For example, in a number of EHEA countries the adherence of academic freedom has deteriorated since 2010. In addition, various studies have suggested a decreasing level of political commitment to Europeanisation of higher education in a growing number of countries. Achieving progress in the coming period in this key part of the EHEA's objectives is difficult also as a result of the problems the overall process of European integration faces. For example, Brexit, the rise of anti-EU political parties and movements, and growing disagreements among EU member states on the key ideas and principles underlying European integration are posing serious challenges for Europe's way forward in higher education collaboration. In this chapter, we will discuss a number of the challenges facing, directly or indirectly, the EHEA. We will start with a discussion of the importance of the rise of science diplomacy for the EHEA, being a consequence of the growing connection between foreign affairs and the higher education & science policy areas. Next, we will analyse the growing intra-European political tensions, with a number of EHEA countries not adhering to basic European values and principles concerning liberal democracy and open societies. Further, we will examine relevant trends in EU-funded higher education collaboration within the EHEA, with special attention for the European University Initiative. Finally, the discussions and analyses presented in the chapter lead to proposing two complementary EHEA trajectories for the coming period, the first implying a move away from the geographical focus on Europe, the second including only those countries that adhere to promoting academic freedom, institutional autonomy and other basic values and principles. Both trajectories take as a starting-point that the EHEA is in need of fundamental reforms.",,8,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

To begin with, it highlights the place-based strategies and practices associated with cosmic-ray research. Once research in the field at different altitudes demonstrated that cosmic rays traveled from outer space to the Earth surface, their nature was scrutinized by expeditions that covered broad vertical and horizontal expanses. The study of cosmic rays in Latin America displayed the mobilization of that strategy, which reinforced the reliability of certain sites located at high altitudes and close to the geomagnetic equator in projected investigations. Moreover, such analysis of cosmic rays involved research practices in the field, the emergence of (local, regional, or international) research traditions, and the creation of spaces of knowledge at different scales. By centering on the interaction of knowledge and place, this paper shows that an exploration of the “up-and-down journeys” of cosmic-ray research in Latin America expands our understanding of the geographies and practices of 20th-century physics.",cosmic rays | field stations | Latin America | physics research communities | science diplomacy | scientific expeditions,2,0,,,RGS,undefined,Royal Geographical Society

The research covers 17 European states: six are Arctic and 11 non-Arctic, which were selected according to the following (at least one) formulated criteria: having an established tradition of carrying out scientific research in the Arctic region; having issued Arctic policy documents and/or Arctic research strategies; participation in the activities of the Arctic Council; and having gained membership of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC). In the analysis we have applied a mixed research method, since it incorporates elements of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and offers a more comprehensive review of the scrutinised texts. The qualitative analysis relies on a discourse analysis (predicate analysis). The quantitative part of the analysis utilizes the instruments of a software research tool – The AntConc. In the end, the outcomes of both methods are merged and compared. The study reveals that conducting scientific research is not a top priority for all Arctic states. However, it has the highest similarity in terms of applied approaches among Arctic states as compared to other fields (e.g. the economy, security or pollution). At the same time, the environment and climate change are perceived to be the most important drivers behind Arctic research as defined in the Arctic states' strategies. Moreover, there are major differences among both Arctic and non-Arctic states in terms of the level of accuracy in the presentation of their research activities, particularly with regard to the implementation of scientific programmes and research aims. Finally, the research indicates that all states highlight that international scientific cooperation stimulates cooperation also in other areas and that research provides information that supports decision making and policy creation.",Arctic policy | Arctic research | Arctic strategies | Science diplomacy | Scientific cooperation,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

First, it was the first large project of the World Wildlife Fund, which is usually seen as a response to the very specific post-imperial challenges of African parks. Second, it was the first non-alpine park in Spain, and although it was designed and inaugurated in the midst of Francisco Franco's nationalist dictatorship, it was an explicitly transnational project. This paper approaches Doñana's unique story through the concept of ecological diplomacy. It points to the diplomatic strategies mobilized by a small group of ecologists with managerial and financial skills. Promoting Doñana, British ornithologists presented it as an African wilderness, which created tensions with Spanish ecologists, themselves colonial scientists. Ecological diplomacy, moreover, refers to a characteristic period between conservation diplomacy and environmental diplomacy. In it, conservation was understood as the top-down management of foreign territories for research purposes. While this can be partly understood as the globalization of the Swiss model for conservation, it arrived in Spain through the mediation of the French Tour du Valat station and of English ecology. Finally, stressing the ecological dimension of this type of conservation diplomacy helps in studying the role of the science of ecology and its transformations. As Doñana became a national park, the WWF's early emphasis on research was replaced by a new attention to recreation. Max Nicholson's participation in the International Biology Program granted him an opportunity to favor this model when Doñana became a national park.

It tackles this through analysis of the various twists, turns, and challenges of early science diplomacy efforts in marine science during the early twentieth century. It looks in turn at questions of defining and agreeing on research objectives, how backchannel science diplomacy can become official government diplomacy, and finally, how careful science diplomacy brought Germany back to the international research arena so as to successfully put in place marine conservation measures during the 1920s. In doing this, it argues that the foundation of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas in 1902 represented a revolutionary moment where supra-national scientific research, coordination, and conservation politics for the ocean first emerged; with International Council for the Exploration of the Sea becoming a key model for all subsequent marine science diplomacy.

Although many scientists aligned themselves with their belligerent nations after 1914, and although Germany and Austria were excluded from international meetings after 1919, the rhetoric celebrating the universally fraternizing nature of science continued as if no such ruptures existed. In this article I argue that this persistence was rooted in the war itself, and particularly in the massive mobilization of academics in wartime propaganda and diplomacy. In these activities they used internationalist arguments and their own supranational status as scientists to defend their countries' war causes and defame those of the enemy. I illustrate this by following the diplomatic work of the French philosopher Henri Bergson. From the start of the war Bergson presented himself as a neutral scientific arbiter, developing a philosophy of the war (based on his work on life and evolution) as a battle of German barbarity versus universal (not just French) civilization. His government took note and sent Bergson on several diplomatic tasks, most notably a secret mission to the United States, early 1917, where he was to speak to President Wilson to persuade him to enter the war on the French side. Bergson's universalism and his stature as a philosopher should appeal to Wilson's dislike of partisanship and craving for the moral high ground. After the war, Bergson-style universalism continued and was institutionalized in the League of Nations and its International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation-with Bergson as its president.

It encouraged US officials to bolster their country's hegemonic role in post-war affairs, something that scholars have previously referred to in terms of “atomic diplomacy.” This paper shows that Cold War atomic diplomacy originated in an ancestral form of what we call today “science diplomacy,” distinctive of wartime allied relations during WW2. It first explores how science became a distinctive feature of wartime diplomacy by looking at agreements regarding exchanges of information and collaboration that shaped the relations between wartime allies (US, UK, and the Soviet Union). It then shows that their signing (and, at times, their rejection) eventually paved the way to conflicting views within allied administrations on what to share, making their officials less inclined to pool more knowledge toward the end of WW2. In conclusion, US monopolistic stances and atomic diplomacy originated in these disagreements, also marking the demise of wartime science diplomacy.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Soviet views on the biosphere prevailed thanks to the influence of Soviet scientists in the International Council of Scientific Unions and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. In the 1980s, the domination of this field by US scientists ushered in the establishment of Earth system science as a new research trend based on Earth observation technologies. We argue that despite the influence of Soviet ecologists in directing international coordination of research on the biosphere, Earth system science did not set in a trajectory of environmental cooperation. This outcome can be explained if we take the environmental and ecological turn that arose during the Cold War as being intertwined with political concerns and national interests in both the US and the USSR. Security, scientific diplomacy, and geopolitical issues limited East-West collaboration on the interdisciplinary study of the earth, which instead turned into a sort of cooperative antagonism. The transition from biosphere studies to Earth system science reveals a changing strategy toward environmental problems, which in turn reflects changes in Cold War policy.

Interest from early career scientists and young diplomats to learn more and engage at the science-diplomacy nexus is growing all around the world. However, as a relatively new and multidisciplinary field, we show that science diplomacy has so far been largely taught through extracurricular courses and workshops, often self-organized by university student groups or international scientific organizations, targeting specific disciplinary and geographic audiences. Given this fragmented landscape, we map and categorize current science diplomacy educational offerings in higher education. Despite some coverage of science diplomacy within general science policy programs or courses focused on an issue area (e.g., water diplomacy or environmental diplomacy), a structured foundational course addressing the commonalities of all the scientific and technological issues relevant to international affairs is still lacking. Hence, we first suggest knowledge and key skills scientists and diplomats can learn from each other to bridge the disciplinary divide and engage in science diplomacy scholarship and practice. Building upon it, we then propose cross-cutting, core concepts that can inform the establishment and consolidation of science diplomacy curricula at universities.

This study reduces science diplomacy to an effective means for the strategic development of nanotechnology in Africa.

African diplomats are state actors in science diplomacy to propose foreign policies that will meet the domestic demand for science and technology development in Africa, especially for emerging technologies like nanotechnology. The necessity of inclusion of competent scientists with diplomatic skills as members of the diplomatic corps is recommended here as one of the ways to develop nanotechnology in Africa. The scientist diplomats will function to foster international scientific collaborations, drive platforms for national research facility development and for non-state actors to thrive in their domestic nano-research. Scientifically informed foreign policies are presented here to have potentials to significantly assist Africa in developing nanotechnology and provide pathways for overcoming the numerous constraints to nanotechnology development in Africa. Critical areas of intervention include human capacity development, national nano-research laboratory facilities, platforms for institutional collaborations, post-graduate student training and robust exchange programs.

This inequality limits the capacity of science to be used as a diplomatic channel. Maker movements use open-source technologies including additive manufacturing (3D printing) and laser cutting, together with low-cost computers for developing novel products. This movement is setting the groundwork for a revolution, allowing scientific equipment to be sourced at a fraction of the cost and has the potential to increase the availability of equipment for scientists around the world. Science education is increasingly recognized as another channel for science diplomacy. In this perspective, we introduce the idea that the Maker movement and open-source technologies have the potential to revolutionize science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education worldwide. We present an open-source STEM didactic tool called SCOPES (Sparking Curiosity through Open-source Platforms in Education and Science). SCOPES is self-contained, independent of local resources, and cost-effective. SCOPES can be adapted to communicate complex subjects from genetics to neurobiology, perform real-world biological experiments and explore digitized scientific samples. We envision such platforms will enhance science diplomacy by providing a means for scientists to share their findings with classrooms and for educators to incorporate didactic concepts into STEM lessons. By providing students the opportunity to design, perform, and share scientific experiments, students also experience firsthand the benefits of a multinational scientific community.

It is estimated that 70–90 percent of all reefs will be severely degraded by mid-century even if the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is achieved. However, one coral reef ecosystem seems to be more resilient to rising sea temperatures than most others. The Red Sea’s reef ecosystem is one of the longest continuous living reefs in the world, and its northernmost portion extends into the Gulf of Aqaba. The scleractinian corals in the Gulf have an unusually high tolerance for the rapidly warming seawater in the region. They withstand water temperature anomalies that cause severe bleaching or mortality in most hard corals elsewhere. This uniquely resilient reef employs biological mechanisms which are likely to be important for coral survival as the planet’s oceans warm. The Gulf of Aqaba could potentially be one of the planet’s largest marine refuges from climate change. However, this unique portion of the Red Sea’s reef will only survive and flourish if serious regional environmental challenges are addressed. Localized anthropogenic stressors compound the effects of warming seawater to damage corals and should be mitigated immediately. Reefs in the rest of the Red Sea are already experiencing temperatures above their thermal tolerance and have had significant bleaching, though they too would benefit from fewer local anthropogenic stressors. The countries bordering the entire Red Sea will need to cooperate to enable effective scientific research and conservation. The newly established Transnational Red Sea Center, based at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), can serve as the regionally inclusive, neutral organization to foster crucial regional scientific collaboration.",climate change | coral bleaching | coral reef | Red Sea | science diplomacy,28,1,repositoryvor,Green,H2020,730984,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Few colleges and universities in the United States adequately prepare students to become scientists with expertise operating in science-policy spaces. Consequently, most academic scientists lack sufficient training in the policy process, exposure to science diplomacy and capacity to deliver science advice. Science-policy relationships are more than the dichotomised paradox of politicisation of science and the scientisation of politics. Adjustments in how scientists teach, research and engage with policy and policy-makers are necessary to better prepare future generations to address global problems.

The government of the Kingdom is well aware that the changes occurring in the Arctic due to ice melting can bring economic benefits in the near future. The tempting prospects motivate the UK to remain one of the world’s top leaders in supporting environmental protection and international cooperation in the region. On the one hand, Britain’s science diplomacy in the Arctic is a tool of reducing tensions and strengthening cooperation with Russia in the economic, financial and political spheres. On the other hand, the scientific activity of the Kingdom in the polar region is a means to consolidate the subarctic status of the country and legitimize its presence in the polar latitudes, which in the future may allow the UK to participate in political and economic processes of the Arctic resources distribution. The joint scientific activity of Russia and Great Britain currently remains, perhaps, one of the few tools that will improve relations between the two countries in the future, establish partnership and prove that mutual cooperation can be beneficial. At the same time, it is obvious that Russia remains the main geopolitical opponent of the UK in the region.

The authors outline six stages of the formation of science diplomacy based on the author methodological approaches to the allocation of periods using the following key indicators: indicators of the science diplomacy processes; indicators of qualification profiles of personnel engaged in science diplomacy; financial indicators; a group of institutional indicators (specifications of the regulatory framework providing for the implementation of activities considered in the science diplomacy, availability of specialized institutions and enterprises that coordinate the implementation of science diplomacy activities, etc.). The authors emphasize that the foundations of the science diplomacy mechanisms in the Russian Federation were laid as early as in the 17th - 19th centuries. An important role in this process was played by the establishment of the Academy of Sciences in 1724 and further complex expeditionary research. The geopolitical model of foreign policy developed during this period determined the nature and scope of events conditionally attributed to the modern term of “science diplomacy”. The article authors emphasize the nature of negative processes that determine the course of science diplomacy development in the country: the emigration of scientists, abandonment of research areas, cessation of the activity of promising laboratories and the excessive ideologization of approaches to the notion of science diplomacy in the Soviet Union in the first half of the 19th century.

Going beyond the model of knowledge diffusion that brings together concerns articulated in Harris's (2011) geographies of long distance knowledge and Reinhardt's (2011) role of the expert in knowledge transfer, the proposed three-phase model of knowledge transfer theorises the pathways undertaken by a late-blooming participant of modern science and technology as the latter moves from epistemic dependency to increasing independence despite the hurdles encountered, and the underdevelopment of many areas of its technoscientific economy. The model considers tensions stemming from the pressures of expediency for meeting national developmental goals on the one side, and the call to support the objectives of basic science on the other. The three phases of the model are epistemic transition, epistemic transplantation and localisation, and epistemic generation (ETTLG). As additional support for the proposed model, three arguments are proffered as deeper explanations of the epistemic goal by using Malaysia as a case study: knowledge transfer for political legitimization, knowledge transfer for countering agnotology, and knowledge transfer for social engineering and science diplomacy.","Agnogenesis | Agnotology | Model of epistemic transition, transplantation, localisation, and generation (ETTLG) | Philosophy of the history of technoscience | Postcolonial science and technology | Southeast Asia nuclear science and technology knowledge transfer",1,0,repositoryam,Green,AIP,undefined,American Institute of Physics

Scientists, being ‘neutral’ representatives of their countries, are looking for answers to the global challenges of our time, common to all of humanity. As Anton Chekhov said: ‘There is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what’s national is no longer a science’. Diplomats are people whose main task is to promote the interests and values of their country on the world stages; therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the development of scientific diplomacy in various countries. As a result of the study, the authors concluded that scientific diplomacy always reflects the interests of a state and therefore differs from international scientific cooperation. At the same time, there are many areas of common interest between science and diplomacy. Diplomats are interested in the key values of science – the universality and neutrality of knowledge, and they, in turn, can contribute to the activities of scientists. The authors conclude that there are many examples in history when scientific problems reached the level of diplomatic relations, and sometimes acted as their catalyst. On the contrary, diplomats often stimulated cooperation between countries in research, science, and technology.

During our Junior year of high school, we were sent to the desert, close to the Red Sea in Israel to build roads. In the summers, we were in a Kibbutz on the border to help with the work needed. After work, we had time to discuss our future. Upon graduating from high school, I was drafted into the army, and in the evenings, started my college education and majored in chemistry. After finishing my term in the army, I continued my undergraduate studies in chemistry while raising my son. As I was conducting research on isotope effects, I realized that I wanted to make chemistry accessible to all. My tenet in life is that equal access to Science Education is a human right. I developed a method of teaching chemistry using art, music, dance, drama, and cultural backgrounds which attracted students at all educational levels to chemistry. I felt that as chemists, we have obligations to make the planet a better place for humankind. At this point, I became very active in working towards Scientific Freedom and Human Rights; helping chemists in the Soviet Union, China, Chile, Guatemala, and many other countries. The American Chemical Society established the Subcommittee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights in 1986 and I chaired this committee for 26 years. At great risk to my personal safety, we succeeded in preventing executions, releasing prisoners of conscience from jail and bringing dissidents to freedom. This work led me to use chemistry as a bridge to peace in the Middle East by organizing Conferences which bring together chemists from 15 Middle East Countries with five Nobel Laureates. The Conferences allow the participants to collaborate on solutions to problems facing the Middle East and the World. The issues are; Air and Water Quality, Alternative Energy Sources, and Science Education at all Levels. Eight conferences were held and the ninth is scheduled for 2019. More than 600 Middle East scientists already participated in these conferences. Considering that most of the participants are professors or directors of science institutions who have access to thousands of students, the number of people in the network is in the thousands. Between the conferences, the cross-border collaborations are ongoing despite the grave situation in the Middle East. In these conferences, the participants succeed in overcoming the chasms of distrust and intolerance. They do not just form collaborations, but form friendships. Hopefully, we will manage to form a critical mass of scientists who will be able to start the chain reaction for peace in the Middle East.

Since his studentship, J. W. Borejsza maintained contacts with Russian colleagues, which became especially intensive at the beginning of the 21 st century. He promoted communication between historians of different countries, attaching great importance to science diplomacy. The portrait of the Polish historian is given in a broad scholarly and political context of the second half of the 20 th and early 21 st centuries. The views of J. Borejsza on a number of topical issues, including his assessment of historical policy, are characterized. Along with the use of the researches of the historian, his recently published memoirs and interviews are introduced into circulation, which the author of the article supplements with own memories of his Polish colleague. Borejsza’s extensive memoirs contain valuable material on the intellectual and political history of Eastern and Western Europe, as well as the history of historical science.",Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza | Polish historical science | Polish political emigration | Polish-Russian scientific relations | totalitarianism,0,0,,,,undefined,

The local level examines Norway's efforts to maintain effective occupation of greater Kongsfjorden by promoting research, underpinned by the economisation of the area's near-pristine natural environment as a non-extractive resource for science; the global level applies the concept of telecoupling to consider the role of events and processes at larger spatial scales that facilitated Ny-Ålesund's transformation; and the glocal level explains how the interaction of Norwegian and global actors in the locality of Ny-Ålesund have collectively shaped the community's institutions over some 30 years.

It is expected that exposure to an exciting topic such as space will not only lead to an uptake in science and other STEM subjects but also instil a sense of common humanity. The use of space/astronomy as a tool to change perspective took centre stage soon after the early days of spaceflight. The term Overview Effect was coined by Frank White to define the “cognitive shift in awareness"" and perspective reported by astronauts when they view Earth from space. Similarly, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized the concept of the 'Pale Blue Dot' which stemmed from an image of Earth, taken from around 6 billion kilometres away, in which it appears as a tiny point of light, less than a pixel in size. Sagan later wrote, the image “underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known”. These ideas form one of the pillars of modern communication on space exploration and have promoted the use of space/astronomy in classrooms. But rarely is the impact of such communication evaluated scientifically. Our team at the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD), in conjunction with the South African Astronomical Observatory and Hosei University conducted a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial to test whether exposure to an astronomy/space intervention affects empathy and altruism in children (that is, whether space/astronomy induces a perspective of 'One Global Humanity', espoused by Carl Sagan and often quoted by many working in the space sector). The results of this pilot program indicate interesting outcomes which could have repercussions on the communication of space topics. We aim to launch a more extensive program under the Flagship project 'Science diplomacy through Astronomy: Celebrating our Common Humanity'.",Astronomy | Empathy | Evaluation | Inspiration | Overview effect | Pale Blue Dot,0,0,,,NRF,undefined,Hosei University

Inspired by these overreaching themes, the paper presents a conceptual framework for pursuing a comparative analysis of IAU and IUPAP. A bird's-eye view of the parallel historical developments of these two unions shows that, in spite of their common origins in the highly politicised context of the post-WWI reconstruction of international cooperation, IAU and IUPAP followed diverging trajectories in many respects.

We use the term ‘nexus’ to designate the interactions between the dynamics of science itself and the dynamics of diplomacy. We focus on the critical role played by the IPCC in the formation of this nexus. We argue that the extent to which diplomats understand and use scientific knowledge as well as that the clashing of national interests during major negotiations can jeopardize science diplomacy effectiveness. We thus explain why the large consensus that exists among scientists about the origins and long-term risks of climate change does not translate into a consensus among diplomats over an appropriate course of action. These findings illustrate the limits of ‘science in diplomacy’.",,17,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

The legislative proposal, legally binding through its adoption by Swiss voters, obliged the Swiss government to take sovereign control over migration management, thereby preventing the ratification of the ‘Croatia Protocol’ that would have, through the EU regime of free movement of persons and the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the EU, granted Croatian citizens free movement to Switzerland. As the refusal to ratify the protocol effectively undercut the bilateral treaties, the EU Commission in turn used the Swiss participation in the European research funding framework Horizon 2020 as leverage to enforce Swiss compliance to the bilateral treaties. This eventually compelled the Swiss government to ratify the Croatia Protocol despite the domestic legal clash with the ‘mass migration initiative’ proposal. Conceptually, the article turns the attention to contradicting policy goals in an emerging EU science diplomacy framework, and shows how science diplomacy in the conflict around the Croatia Protocol got stuck between a liberal ‘carrot’ and a realist ‘stick’.",,3,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

These scheduled chemicals must be declared by the States that possess them and are subject to verification by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW, the implementing body of the CWC). Isotopically labelled and stereoisomeric variants of the scheduled chemicals have presented ambiguities for interpretation of the requirements of treaty implementation, and advice was sought from the OPCW's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) in 2016. The SAB recommended that isotopically labelled compounds or stereoisomers related to the parent compound specified in a schedule should be interpreted as belonging to the same schedule. This advice should benefit scientists and diplomats from the CWC's State Parties to help ensure a consistent approach to their declarations of scheduled chemicals (which in turn supports both the correctness and completeness of declarations under the CWC). Herein, isotopically labelled and stereoisomeric variants of CWC-scheduled chemicals are reviewed, and the impact of the SAB advice in influencing a change to national licensing in one of the State Parties is discussed.

As the challenges of the world increasingly transcend borders, so too have researchers and innovators forged international coalitions to resolve global pathologies. In doing so, new channels of influence and opportunity have opened up for states alongside the ‘traditional’ modes of foreign diplomacy. Understanding how these channels influence global socio-economic outcomes is thereby crucial for scholars interested in the still-ambiguous structure and processes of global governance. This article advances understanding of the domains of science diplomacy by drawing attention to the ‘political intercostalities’ of state actors, scientific communities and other transnational actors within the new architectures of global governance. Here we trace the growing array of informal international associations alongside transgovernmental policy networks and ‘global public-policy partnerships’ that deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy and how they are drawn into science diplomacy.

This contribution provides a better understanding of the under-researched development of this policy domain, asking how and why the EU has extended the scope of its external activities in the scientific area. To answer these questions, it conducts an analysis of EU policy-makers' discourses on external science policies inspired by role theory. It finds that EU role conceptions in this domain take the forms of ‘science for diplomacy’ or ‘diplomacy for science’, and that they correspond either to an image of normative or market power Europe. These findings are confirmed by a study of the EU's recent external science policies. The article argues that the ambiguity of rationales invoked for introducing a genuine science diplomacy in the EU helps to appeal to different constituencies. This, in turn, enhances the Union's chances for successfully expanding the scope of its activities.",foreign policy | Market Power Europe | Normative Power Europe | research and development | science diplomacy,20,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

We examine notions of ‘culture’, ‘value’ and ‘practice’ as the key elements of this methodology and follow their interconnections and mutual determination. The prospects of the methodology based on these notions is evaluated from the point of view of its applicability to investigations of national cultures, science as a special type of culture, diplomatic community, which can also be considered in possession of a peculiar group culture. We examine the relations of ‘culture’ and ‘practice’ on the one hand with ‘paradigm’ in the initial Kuhnian sense on the other and attempt to lay ground for application of the latter beyond analysis of scientific research. We also consider application in a wider context of postpositivist methodologies of such authors as philosophers I. Lakatos, P. Feuerabend, sociologists N. Gilbert and M. Mulkay, social psychologist I. Mitroff. The concepts of the three latter authors are seen as a solution to the problem of the inner contradictions of cultures. The core of the Gilbert and Mulkay’s method is the separation of discourse practices in accordance with their sphere of application and in grouping them in different repertoires. And the basis of Mitroff’s method is in psychoanalytic approach to individual ambivalence, which provides ground for recognition of the fact that each norm, adopted by an in individual, is complemented by an opposite norm that allows flexible adaptation to different social situations. Cultures differ not so much in norms themselves as in the forms of expression these norms acquire, which provide for their implementation or in especially expository cases block implementation of an opposite norm. The main thesis of the article is that these approaches, developed in philosophy, sociology and psychology of science can be successfully employed in analysis of cultures of a much wider range of communities than just scientific community. We suggest examination of the diplomatic community as one possible example. Employing the Kuhn’s theory it can be characterized as a community of ‘translators’, providing means of communication between incompatible world-views, in other words, they possess a new paradigm constructed in order to combine previously existing ‘incommensurable’ ones.",Cultural psychology | Psychology of diplomacy | Research culture | Social psychology of science,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

That is why nowadays the possibilities of science diplomacy and its prospects have become widely discussed in the scientific community. The definition of science diplomacy was developed during the conference “New Horizons of Science Diplomacy” which took place in June 2009 and was organized by the Royal Society of London in cooperation with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This definition was the most common among Western researchers and officials. Scientists from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America discussed the new role and prospects of science diplomacy in the modern world. According to the concept proposed by the two largest scientific organizations of Great Britain and the United States which was published in the report on the results of the conference, science diplomacy includes three dimensions: “science in diplomacy”; “diplomacy for science”; “science for diplomacy”. It is to this definition that both foreign and domestic experts refer and operate. Despite the fact that the term “science diplomacy” appears in the Russian Strategy for Scientific and Technological Development 2016 and is often used in the media in the publications devoted to the prospects of science diplomacy, Russian scientists and diplomats have still no clear views and consensus on what exactly includes or should include this concept, what are the goals and means of science diplomacy, what distinguishes science diplomacy from international scientific and technical cooperation and foreign policy, and how to implement science diplomacy techniques in practice. The article presents the results of a series of semi-structured interviews with Russian experts involved at the administrative level in organizing international cooperation in the field of science, and therefore involved in the process of designing science diplomacy. Respondents, including experts from the scientific foundations of the RSF and RFBR, responsible for international cooperation, employees of diplomatic educational institutions of MGIMO and the Diplomatic Academy, as well as the specialists in international relations who are directly involved in the realization of diplomatic goals of Russia, gave their definition of “science diplomacy” and also analyzed the tasks, methods and expediency of identifying three dimensions of science diplomacy by Western researchers. Interviews were built around the definition of science diplomacy tools, evaluating the effectiveness of their use and differences from scientific policy techniques, and therefore the most interesting for this study were questions relating to specific examples and practices that characterize each dimension of sciecne diplomacy. Based on the analysis of interview results and respondents' answers, the author comes to the conclusion that the third dimension of science diplomacy – “science for diplomacy” – has the greatest practical value for Russian experts in the context of the influence and interaction of scientists and diplomats within the framework of international cooperation.",S&amp;TS | Science diplomacy | Science policy | Scientific foundations,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

The Weberian model of generalization and the path dependency theory of constructing an ideal type were used as the study's theoretical frameworks. An ideal type of SD is viewed not as universal, but as a heuristic device that can be contrasted and compared with other recognized cases of SD.

Recent advances in technology, commercial proprietary discovery and current local and global events (e.g., emerging human, animal and plant disease outbreaks) have increased the demand, and shortened optimal timelines for material and data exchange, both domestically and internationally. Specific circumstances in each case, such as the type of material being transferred (i.e., select agent, disease-causing agent and assessed biosafety risk level) and current events, dictate the level of agreements and requirements. Recent lessons learned from emerging disease issues and emergencies have demonstrated that human engagement and increased science diplomacy are needed to reinforce and sustain biosafety and biosecurity practices and processes, for better scientific transparency. A reasonable and accepted framework of guidance for open sharing of data and materials is needed that can be applied on multiple cooperative levels, including global and national. Although numerous agreement variations already exist for the exchange of materials and data, regulations to guide the development of both the language and implementation of such agreements are limited. Without such regulations, scientific exchange is often restricted, limiting opportunities for international capacity building, collaboration and cooperation. In this article, we present and discuss several international case histories that illustrate the complex nature of scientific exchange. Recommendations are made for a dual bottom-up and top-down approach that includes all stakeholders from beginning negotiation stages to emphasize trust and cooperation. The broader aim of this approach is to increase international scientific transparency and trust in a safe and open manner, supporting increased global one health security.",Biosafety and biosecurity | Emerging pandemic threats | Material data transfer | One health | Public health preparedness | Scientific transparency,5,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This term encompasses a particular form of public diplomacy and refers to the use of scientific collaborations among nations to tackle common challenges. Science Diplomacy operates on the assumption that many of today's problems—food, water, energy, climate, and health—cannot be solved by any single state and, more often than not, require international technical or scientific solutions. Does Science Diplomacy represent a major paradigm change or simply a minor adjustment in the making of foreign policy? In the Indo-Pacific, the need for Science Diplomacy is clear, but at present there are mixed signals on whether states in the region are really prepared to develop its potential. On one hand, the Square Kilometre Array project—the construction of a large radio telescope in Australia and South Africa from 2018—represents a good example of a multilateral diplomatic effort to facilitate and extend scientific collaboration to dramatically improve human capabilities to survey the sky. On the other, science diplomacy has so far largely failed to live up to its potential to address climate change, the most significant threat to the future of the Indo-Pacific region and the world beyond. However, successful efforts to make Ross Sea a global marine sanctuary also shows that, despite obstacles, Science Diplomacy can sometime have spillover effects into political decision making with positive outcomes. This mixed picture highlights a paradox. While the emergence of Science Diplomacy reflects a recognition by states that a growing number of national problems require international scientific solutions, such recognition remains patchy and somewhat uneven. Many states, particularly the most powerful ones, continue to be constrained in the international arena by the old Westphalian idea of unfettered state sovereignty.",Climate Change | Decision Making | Indo-Pacific | Ross Sea | Science Diplomacy | Sovereignty | Square Kilometre Array | Transnational Problem Solving,3,0,,,,undefined,

These models are framed by an assertion that our planet holds a vast reserve that could define the 21st century as profoundly as oil has shaped the 20th century. They are premised on a comparison: Unlike oil or mineral ores whose global volume is just a sum of their deposits across the world, the 21st-century reserve—the yet-to-be-tapped scientific knowledge embedded in biologically opulent landscapes and seascapes—grows in volume and worth in the context of evolutionary, ecological, and other relationships that transcend regions and political borders. They are grounded in legacy-investment opportunities whose competitiveness and prestige grow along with the geographical footprint of the research they underwrite. While various stages of these models’ conceptualization and validation have been published in scholarly journals and enriched with endorsements by several members and officers of the United States National Academy of Sciences and by heads of state and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) leaders, this article is the first comprehensive presentation of both.

Why are we surprised when cyber-attacks disrupt our IT systems, internal spies publish our protected information, mentally ill or volatile individuals attack police and innocent people, and trusted state or federal employees turn out to be untrustworthy and release critical secrets to enemies or the world? These are all attributable to failures in the ability of people to work together, or collaborate, for our protection. The failure is not that of the first responders or warfighters, to whom this book is dedicated. On the contrary, these heroes must show superior initiative and risk self-sacrifice while the stove-piped-organization system planners and vendors with no skin in the game risk nothing. These leaders, planners, scientists, engineers, managers, administrators, salespeople and others are wholly responsible for the technological innovation, processes and products used, but these people are almost never on-scene when an incident occurs. Part I of our book explains to both the general reader and homeland security experts alike, what individual and organizational factors are needed to establish a collaborative environment. These factors include organizational trust, knowledge management, organizational structure, organizational culture, and leadership. These collaboration factors provide the basis for Part II, where we look at the important contributions of actual homeland security practitioners. These practitioners describe the role of human collaboration in making peace, bombing the Third Reich (by a member of the Greatest Generation), disaster management, public safety communications interoperability, electric power restoration, medical support for mass sheltering, government healthcare, cybersecurity, science diplomacy, technology innovation, government acquisition, systems engineering, and intellectual property litigation. Finally, in Part III, we describe a methodology for comprehensive collaboration planning (CCP) to optimize planning for day-to-day or rare ""grey swan"" or unexpected ""black swan"" events. In the end, we show that achieving these five collaboration factors ultimately requires direct interaction between the people involved in any homeland security endeavor, and not the technology they envision, develop, buy, sell, deploy, operate and sustain. It does not matter what you buy if the people who use it - or with whom they must collaborate in a crisis as well as day-to-day unexpected events - do not have their act together. The bottom line is that how well people do together in any homeland security (or other) domain depends exclusively on the success of human-to-human interoperability and interaction. This interaction is governed by long-known and waning (in an e-world) rules of civility, such as George Washington documented and practiced some time ago. With Forewords by renowned historian Edwin Bearss, experienced homeland security practitioner Ken Born, and mental health professional Anthony Rogers, the emphasis of this book (""it's the people, not the stuff"") demonstrates the success of our homeland security ? and everything else, including the technology utilized ? is solely dependent on how well the people work together.

Design/methodology/approach: The method is a conceptual exploration, using specific case studies and potential scenarios within theories and practices of science diplomacy and duty of care, to raise questions and to suggest policy recommendations for government. The focus on disaster research links the analysis to disaster diplomacy, namely, how and why disaster-related activities (in this case, science) do and do not influence peace and conflict. Findings: From examining case studies of, and outputs and outcomes from, disaster-related science diplomacy, governments need to consider duty of care issues in advance and develop a science diplomacy strategy, rather than responding after the fact or developing policy ad hoc. Practical implications: Policy recommendations are provided to try to ensure that governments avoid simply reacting after a crisis, instead being ready for a situation before it arises and drawing on others’ experience to improve their own actions. Social implications: Improved interaction between science and society is discussed in the context of diplomacy, especially for disaster-related activities.

Stations can be used as indicator of this transformation as well as their implications to improve cooperation, engage in multilateral rather than unilateral actions to protect the Arctic infrastructures and to improve military capabilities. These actions have started to attract also non-Arctic actors, such as China and the European Union (EU), which are developing new policies. Stations may not be developed and maintained only not only for the purpose of the scientific understanding of climatic and environmental impacts but also for function as entities that legitimize national or sovereign claims. At the nexus are the scientists that utilize the research bases and their international colleagues. Arctic/Northern bases are primarily military for historical reasons and for reasons of logistics and expertise, as historically indicated through the American presence in Alaska. This is not the same as saying that the bases are militarized—or part of some national militarization strategy in the Arctic.

Therefore, a synergy framework of EOC is needed in a national polar programme to strengthen and sustain the public’s awareness and interest on the polar regions. Consequently, the information from this paper is important for policy makers and national polar governance in developing the future strategy of coordinating stakeholders and funds for EOC initiatives, especially during the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP).",Antarctic | Arctic | Education for sustainability development | Environmental education,3,0,,,,undefined,

Non-Arctic countries, including China, and regional organizations such as the European Union will be invited to join the ensuing negotiations. Participation would strengthen China's interest in Arctic affairs in a cooperative fashion, in contrast to a perception that China is interested solely in extracting Arctic resources and is thus a competitor with Arctic states. China's scientific capacity, including the icebreaker Xuelong (Snow Dragon), provides it with an opportunity to practice marine and polar science diplomacy and to contribute further to Arctic cooperation and collaborative understanding.

Since the beginning of negotiations, the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) remained the centerpiece of India’s stand. The stand started to evolve at the 15th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at Copenhagen in 2009, when India accepted voluntary commitments to reduce emission intensity. Though India still swears by CBDR, status of the principle in the negotiations has become doubtful after the Durban Climate Conference in 2011 committed all parties to take emission targets. This paper traces major transition points in India’s negotiating position over the years and provides a descriptive context of its climate-related concerns. It analyzes the interview responses of 15 top scientists, experts, and negotiators to build upon core areas of climate change issues in India, its future role, and position in negotiations.

This article provides an exploration into how these changes are shaping the formation of new local and national Antarctic social imaginaries. Through an account of a digital storytelling project carried out in the Antarctic Peninsula in 2012 and 2013 with young Chilean students, the article first examines cultural production processes at play in the configuration of a contemporary Antarctic national imaginary in Chile, arguing that such processes operate through a set of overlapping symbolic and material arrangements. Second, it reflects on how a performative focus on the experiences of young people doing science in Antarctica provides an innovative shift for understanding digital storytelling not only in terms of media democracy, but also rethinking its expediency as a novel mode of science diplomacy and democratisation of science. Third, and in framing the creative engagement process, the article considers the importance of bringing attention to thinking about globalism from the southern hemisphere in the context of the increasing significance that the Antarctic region holds for Southern Ocean rim countries. Highlighting the challenge of developing science-citizens interfaces, the article concludes by suggesting that we consider the complex entanglements between geopolitics, science and citizenship in a broader setting if we are to acknowledge that citizens engagement with critical scientific debates and decisions that affect their futures is today more pertinent than ever.",Antarctica | Citizens And Science | Digital Storytelling | Social Imaginary,6,0,,,,undefined,

The purpose of the Conferences is to provide a forum for the discussion of scientific and educational issues of importance to the region and the world that transcend geopolitical boundaries and international politics, and for the development of collaborations among the participants. The topics that are discussed include air and water quality, renewable energy sources, bio-medicinal chemistry, nanotechnology and material science, chemistry safety and security, and chemistry education at all levels. The Conferences are dedicated to the use of science diplomacy as a bridge toward peace in that troubled and very important region of the world. They feature plenary lectures by the Nobel Laureates, workshops, oral and poster presentations by participants from the Middle East, and ample time for everyone to make personal and professional connections. The result over the past decade has been the establishment of international cooperation in areas of basic and applied research that hold promise for the development of innovative products, processes, and educational resources. Prior to 2011, the Conferences were organized by a committee with representatives from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Royal Society of Chemisry of Great Britain (RSC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and the German Chemical Society (GDCh); since that time, they have been organized by the Malta Conferences Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization incorporated in Washington, DC www.MaltaConferencesFoundation.org/.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

Did American science diplomacy backfire in Indonesia and, if so, why? Most literature fails to anticipate this possibility, let alone explain it, since science diplomacy is rarely subject to critical analysis. Rather than shun politics or, similarly, simply blame the demise of NAMRU-2 on the military or avian influenza, I consider both the successes and failures of this research unit in the context of Indonesia’s transition to democracy and America’s legacy from the Cold War. Based on this history, I propose that the effects of science diplomacy depend on strategic communication and exchange, as well as elite influence and material incentives.

This science diplomacy and biotechnology journalism article introduces an original concept and policy petition to innovate the global translational science, a Science Peace Corps. Service at the new Corps could entail volunteer work for a minimum of 6 weeks, and up to a maximum of 2 years, for translational research in any region of the world to build capacity manifestly for development and peace, instead of the narrow bench-to-bedside model of life science translation. Topics for translational research are envisioned to include all fields of life sciences and medicine, as long as they are linked to potential or concrete endpoints in development, foreign policy, conflict management, post-crisis capacity building, and/or peace scholarship domains. As a new instrument in the global science and technology governance toolbox, a Science Peace Corps could work effectively, for example, towards elucidating the emerging concept of ""one health"" - encompassing human, environmental, plant, microbial, ecosystem, and planet health - thus serving as an innovative crosscutting pillar of 21st century integrative biology. An interdisciplinary program of this caliber for development would link 21st century life sciences to foreign policy and peace, in ways that can benefit many nations despite their ideological differences. We note that a Science Peace Corps is timely. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations released the Fifth Assessment Report on March 31, 2014. Worrisomely, the report underscores that no person or nation will remain untouched by the climate change, highlighting the shared pressing life sciences challenges for global society. To this end, we recall that President John F. Kennedy advocated for volunteer work that has enduring, transgenerational, and global impacts. This culminated in establishment of the Peace Corps in 1961. Earlier, President Abraham Lincoln aptly observed, ""nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."" We therefore petition President Barack Obama, other world leaders, and international development agencies in positions of power around the globe, to consider deploying a Science Peace Corps to cultivate the essential (and presently missing) ties among life sciences, foreign policy, development, and peace agendas. A Science Peace Corps requires support by a credible and independent intergovernmental organization or development agency for funding, and arbitration in the course of volunteer work when the global versus local (glocal) value-based priorities and human rights intersect in synergy or conflict. In all, Science Peace Corps is an invitation to a new pathway for competence in 21st century science that is locally productive and globally competitive. It can open up scientific institutions to broader considerations and broader inputs, and thus cultivate vital translational science in a world sorely in need of solidarity and sustainable responses to the challenges of 21st century science and society. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",,4,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Equally inspiring is their ability to generate novel institutions and global communities around emergent sciences, which radicalize the forms of public engagement and ethical deliberation. We are starting to witness alternative (iGEM competitions) and almost underground R&D engagements with Synthetic Biology (DIYbio movement), which inspired the emerging bottom-up involvements in nanotechnologies in projects, such as the NanoSmanoLab in Slovenia. These bottom-up involvements use tinkering and design as models for both research and public engagement. They democratize science and initiate a type of grassroots ""science diplomacy"", supporting research in developing countries. We will discuss several recent examples, which demonstrate these novel networks (""Gene gun"" project by Rüdiger Trojok from the Copenhagen based hackerspace, Labitat.dk, the ""Bioluminescence Project"" by Patrik D'haeseleer from Biocurious biotech hackerspace in Sunnyvale, CA, and the ""Biodesign for the real world"" project by members of the Hackteria.org). They all use design prototypes to enable collaborative and global tinkering, in which science and community are brought together in open biology laboratories and DIYbio hackerspaces, such as Hackteria.org or Biocurious. In these projects research protocols encompass broader innovative, social and ethical norms. Hackerspaces represent a unique opportunity for a more inclusive, experimental, and participatory policy that supports both public and global involvements in emergent scientific fields. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Codes of conduct | Cosmopolitics | Design | DIYbio | Hackerspaces | IGEM | Policy | Prototypes | Science diplomacy,26,0,,,NUS,MOE2009-T2-2-013,National University of Singapore

Providing a new area of academic focus that has only gathered momentum in the last few years, this book considers these questions by bringing together a distinguished team of international specialists to look at various facets of how diplomacy and science are influenced by each other. The book not only dissects the ways that politics, science and diplomacy have become intertwined, but also highlights how the world’s seemingly most intractable problems can be tackled with international collaboration and diplomacy that is rooted in science, and driven by technology. It, therefore, challenges the conventional wisdom concerning the juxtaposition of science and the world of diplomacy.",,21,0,,,,undefined,

The case of climate change offers valuable lessons concerning current institutional design patterns of this interface, building on more than two decades of experience with of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In this chapter I depart from the usual approach to analysing the role of science in diplomacy. Instead of assessing the functioning and processes of the IPCC, I use a cognitive perspective to analyse how diplomats’ minds receive and make use of scientifi c knowledge. Using interview data from 2012, I argue that: (1) most negotiation participants use a very basic and limited set of insights about climate change that has not changed signifi cantly for a long time; (2) that recent scientifi c concepts-most notably the idea of climatic tipping points-are not yet part of most diplomats’ belief systems; and (3) that hardly any negotiator is able to imagine qualitatively different long-term futures that have been affected by climate change, and to link present decisions to those possible futures. I discuss the implications of these fi ndings for the negotiation process and outline possible ways to improve the design of the science-diplomacy interface to address present cognitive limitations.",,10,0,,,,undefined,

Crop genetic resources are increasingly understood to be integral to combating this challenge, and consequently interest in the erosion of biodiversity and the related loss of plant genetic variation has grown signifi cantly in recent years. Given the enormous interdependence of both countries and generations on this genetic diversity, its conservation and sustainable use are of global concern and have profound implications. This chapter seeks to assess the current state of international efforts to manage plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA), and to explore some of the attendant challenges through a closer look at the New Zealand experience. The protection of PGRFA is reliant on technical and scientifi c innovation, collaboration and expertise, and thus presents a clear opportunity to operationalise the science diplomacy framework. As a small country heavily dependent on ' soft’ power and deeply invested in the outcome of international negotiations and efforts in this area, New Zealand has a chance to harness science diplomacy in a way that is benefi cial for all-both by contributing to global efforts to manage and conserve PGRFA and by using our related scientifi c skills and experience to advance our diplomatic interests overseas. However, Wellington’s ability to do so is inherently shaped by a range of political, economic, legal and cultural considerations. Given the vital importance of PGRFA for ensuring future food production in the face of fundamental environmental and demographic changes, understanding the potential of science diplomacy in this area-and also its limitations-is an important step forward.",,3,0,,,,undefined,

The complex connectedness of modern society and politics compels us to investigate the pattern of interconnections among actors who inhabit social and political spaces. Gabriella Paár-Jákli’s study aims to advance theory and practice by examining the networks used by specialists in North America and Europe to achieve their policy goals in the area of science and technology. Her book suggests that to overcome policy problems transnationally, three critical factors should be considered. First, as science and technology policy becomes increasingly critical to resolving global issues, it should be regarded as an integral element of the foreign policy process. Second, as liberal international relations theory argues, the increasing role of NGOs must be taken seriously alongside states as vital agents of policy reform. Third, as transatlantic relations remain center to maintaining the global order, they must be reconsidered. Paar-Jakli assesses the role of digital networks as facilitators of regional cooperation. Utilizing various techniques of social network analysis, her research indicates an active and structurally discernible network in cyberspace among transatlantic organizations, and demonstrates the role of virtual networks as facilitators of cooperative arrangements in transatlantic relations. Paár-Jákli’s original research uses social network analysis to investigate transatlantic cooperation, a new approach that will be noteworthy to network and transatlantic scholars as well as policymakers.",European politics | Global governance | Globalization | International relations theory | Political communication | Politics &amp; the media | Science &amp; technology policy | Transnationalism,11,0,,,,undefined,

Metadata capture what happens on the backstage of science, on the trajectory from study conception, design, funding, implementation, and analysis to reporting. Definitions of metadata vary, but they can include the context information surrounding the practice of science, or data generated as one uses a technology, including transactional information about the user. As the pursuit of knowledge broadens in the 21st century from traditional ""science of whats"" (data) to include ""science of hows"" (metadata), we analyze the ways in which metadata serve as a catalyst for responsible and open innovation, and by extension, science diplomacy. In 2015, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will formally come to an end. Therefore, we propose that metadata, as an ingredient of responsible innovation, can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the post-2015 agenda. Such responsible innovation, as a collective learning process, has become a key component, for example, of the European Union's 80 billion Euro Horizon 2020 R&D Program from 2014-2020. Looking ahead, OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology, is launching an initiative for a multi-omics metadata checklist that is flexible yet comprehensive, and will enable more complete utilization of single and multi-omics data sets through data harmonization and greater visibility and accessibility. The generation of metadata that shed light on how omics research is carried out, by whom and under what circumstances, will create an ""intervention space"" for integration of science with its socio-technical context. This will go a long way to addressing responsible innovation for a fairer and more transparent society. If we believe in science, then such reflexive qualities and commitments attained by availability of omics metadata are preconditions for a robust and socially attuned science, which can then remain broadly respected, independent, and responsibly innovative.

Sometimes controversially referred to as the Special Relationship, Anglo-American relations constitute arguably the most important bilateral relationship of modern times. However, in recent years, there have been frequent pronouncements that this relationship has lost its 'specialness'. This volume brings together experts from Britain, Europe and North America in a long-overdue examination of contemporary Anglo-American relations that paints a somewhat different picture. The discussion ranges widely, from an analysis of the special relationship of culture and friendship, to an examination of both traditional (e.g. nuclear relations) and more recent (e.g. environment) policies. Contemporary developments are discussed in the context of longer-term trends and contributing authors draw upon a range of different disciplines, including political science, diplomacy studies,business studies and economics. Coupled with a substantive introduction and conclusion, the result is an insightful and engaging portrayal of the complex Anglo-American relationship. The book will be of great interest to students of US and UK foreign policy, diplomacy and international relations in general. © 2013 selection and editorial material, Alan P.

Also Japanese engineering products and personal electronics are highly-praised and respected in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. Therefore, requests for joint research with Japanese scientists and companies are in high demand in this region. [1] Owing to their diverse and time honored national characters, political systems and established foundations of national finance, there are many different aspects and qualities of the major oil and natural gas producing countries that supply Japan such as the Arab countries in the Gulf as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, and the North African countries Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. However, there are also similarities within these countries such as (1) their lifestyle based on Islamic culture, (2) their desire to develop their own high-tech industries, and (3) their use of the Arabic language. Therefore, it is highly likely that the valuable experience that we SSB project members have accumulated in our Algeria-Japan cooperation project can also be applied in these countries as well. In this paper I will demonstrate how the “Sahara Solar Breeder Project (SSB)” is a science based industrial oriented bottom up approach project between Japan and the Arab countries and how Japanese Science and Technology should collaborate and work in partnership with the Arab countries based on the in depth experience derived from the SSB project. In addition, I will discuss the future of science and technology diplomacy, resource diplomacy and energy security between Japan and the Arab countries. © 2013, JAPAN MACRO-ENGINEERS SOCIETY.

U.S. national interests in the Moon mandate that NASA establish a long-term and continuous U.S. governmental presence on the Moon before international and private missions. The activities conducted at a NASA moon base would be to learn and demonstrate long-term operation of an extraterrestrial base; develop long-term life support systems at an extraterrestrial base; determine the long-term effects of 1/6 gravity on humans; develop the management and technical approaches that keep cost down, allowing permanence; conduct lunar geology and geophysics, astronomy, Earth observation, and other science as proposed and reviewed by the science community; and inspire students and the public. The U.S. Antarctic Program provides a useful analog for how a science program can be an important part of national policy. The U.S. Antarctic Program ensures that the United States has an active and influential presence in Antarctica, designed to support the range of U.S. Antarctic interests. The ""Science Diplomacy"" motivation, the unified organization within a federal agency, and the field operations of the U.S. Antarctic Program can all be applied to a NASA research base on the Moon. The key challenge to maintaining a long-term NASA base on the Moon is keeping the run-out cost to a fraction of NASA's total budget - I suggest 10% or less. The U.S. Antarctic Program operation within the National Science Foundation is about 5% of that agency's total budget.",,7,0,,,,undefined,

This article considers the emerging phase of the modern phosphorus sustainability movement. It provides a first profiling overview of platforms working towards more sustainable production, consumption, and reuse of phosphorus (P) within the frame of securing global food production and environmental quality. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the movement, pertinent literature, the problem sphere itself, and of forms of possible engagement.

Singapore's Biopolis partakes in general cultural shifts towards biological and ecological sensibilities as responses to fears of pandemics, climate change, destruction of biodiversity, and toxicities produced by industrial agriculture and manufacturing. The issue is learning about biorepair mechanisms and creating new ecologies of knowledge involving not only interest in infectious or chronic diseases but also stem and iPS cells, cancers and regenerative medicine. Using the Genome Institute of Singapore's first ten years as a partial focus, this article suggests metrics of success (beyond merely money, jobs, patents) which lie in three arenas: infectious diseases, cross-national science diplomacy and regenerative medicine.

Brilliant course participants included trainees, scientists and clinicians from the Greater Middle East. The lectures and practical sessions, presented by internationally acknowledged scientists, included overviews of recent achievements in pluripotent stem cell research, emphasizing the role of both the embryonic (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. A major emphasis was placed on the clinical achievements in germ cell and umbilical cord stem cell transplantation issues, and on the potential of fast and successful prenatal and pre-implantation molecular genetics diagnostics. The organization of the stem cell course in the Holy Land especially emphasized that issues of ""eternal life"" and ""rejuvenation"" are already at hand-at least in the pluripotent stem cell research field. In the lively atmosphere of the course about 60 participants had heated discussions on the possibility and ethics of advanced prenatal diagnostics, and on regulatory issues reflecting the need of separation of clinically effective versus unapproved, unwarranted stem cell treatments. An open discussion of many ethical issues, reflecting profound differences in religion and medical tradition in the different countries, made this course exceptionally interesting for both teachers and trainees. © 2011 The Author(s).",Education | Fertility | Genetics | Germ cells | Global cooperation | Induced Pluripotency | International | Jordan | Middle East | PGD | Science Diplomacy | Stem cells | Training,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization"

In the Middle East, the chronically water-short Israeli-Palestinian region has recognized the need both to conserve and supplement its traditional water sources. Across the globe on the North American continent, Arizona-a state in the southwestern United States bordering Mexico-relies significantly on the overallocated Colorado River, as well as on non-renewable groundwater supplies. For both regions, sustainable and cost-effective solutions clearly require innovative, multifaceted, and conflict-avoiding approaches. This volume is predicated on the role that “science diplomacy” can play in resolving difficult water-related issues. The history of natural-resources disputes confirms that the scientific approach can reveal ways to overcome division. Experience has shown that scientifically-trained experts who are sensitive to sociopolitical conditions can assist in developing and evaluating feasible water management solutions. The insights and expertise of a distinguished and diverse group of researchers fill these chapters. Contributors include established authorities as well as a number of budding scholars. In a field traditionally dominated by males and by engineers, this collection benefits from significant gender diversity and contributions from a broad spectrum of disciplines. Policymakers, water managers, specialists such as university researchers and consultants, and citizens all have an interest in finding sustainable strategies to address the many water-management issues discussed in this volume.

Apart from these barriers, another drawback is the inadequate incorporation of high-throughput data into cancer clinical settings. The available instruments in Iran are essentially limited to the level of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis equipment. However, opportunity still exists for collaboration with proteomic centers equipped with mass spectrometry abroad while local scientists contributing to proteomics study conception, design and implementation. In this article, we discuss the current OMICS data-intensive research conducted in Iran, with a view to ""proteomics-in-oncology"", considering in parallel the effects of international sanctions on the ongoing research in the country. The lessons learned have broad importance to inform the global personalized medicine scientific community on the ways in which postgenomics science is presently making strides in resource-limited settings. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",Cancer | Innovation analysis | Iran | Personalized medicine | Post-genomics innovations | Proteomics | Public health | Science diplomacy,1,0,,,,undefined,

It seeks to understand the role of S&T in Sino-US relations, how the relationship has affected Chinese scientific development and, more generally, to better understand the ways S&T affect - and are affected by - the foreign policies of nation states. Design/methodology/approach: Employing an institutional perspective, the paper is based on interviews in China and the USA and reviews of government documents and press reports. Findings: Owing to the impacts of the Cultural Revolution on Chinese S&T, the relationship is highly asymmetrical when it began in the late 1970s. As Chinese capabilities have improved, aided measurably by the relationship with the USA, the two sides are now in a position to cooperate more fully across a wide range of areas of interest to both sides. Channels for cooperation have been developed through the two governments, through Chinese and US corporations and through academic institutions in the two countries. Together, these allow for collaborative activities in basic science, commercial research and development, and in S&T in support of public goods. Originality/value: The Sino-US relationship in S&T has become more important to the two countries as they face an array of daunting challenges of energy, public health, basic research, and new industrial technologies. Yet, the relationship has not been extensively studied in spite of its growing importance. This paper attempts to help overcome this neglect. A better understanding of the relationship will contribute to improved understandings of Sino-US relations more generally, and to the ways in which S&T fit into the foreign relations of major powers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",China | International cooperation | International relations | United States of America,3,0,,,,undefined,

A large number of trade agreements rely on scientific expertise for their work. Science is negotiated in setting environmental and health standards: trade disputes had highlighted the role of science as the legal test in the WTO. Historically, it was the negotiations on agriculture that triggered interest in science as an alternative approach to regulating trade, with food safety emerging as a major concern. The recent extension of the phytosanitary domain to include biosafety represents the biggest challenge to the trade policy – a challenge of taking the WTO into the area of adjudicating on the appropriateness of domestic regulations. Forming and managing the scientific consensus underlying trade-related rule-making, standard-setting and regulatory activities at the national, regional and international levels present formidable challenges. The notion of science diplomacy refers to activities of international cooperation and compromise on issues with a heavy scientific input. These activities and resulting networks offer excellent opportunities to share resources and hedge against diplomatic failures through exchanging experiences, opening countries up to better funding opportunities from international sources and sharing organisational capacity and expertise. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","agricultural biotechnology | precaution | science | science diplomacy | standards | substantial equivalence | trade policy | WTO, SPS, Cartagena Protocol",3,0,,,,undefined,
