Using insights from three strands of literature, we compare four IGSOs with Southern participation: the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the Square Kilometer Array, and the African Lightsource.

Several countries of the Global South have joined established IGSOs or have created new ones. Yet we know little about their interests in IGSOs. Our study addresses this blind spot by investigating which objectives Southern actors pursue in IGSOs and under which conditions they are likely to achieve their objectives. Using insights from three strands of literature, we compare four IGSOs with Southern participation: the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the Square Kilometer Array, and the African Lightsource. We show that countries of the Global South pursue a multitude of political and scientific objectives in IGSOs, ranging from capacity-building to casting off political isolation.

Regarding teaching, the importance of approaching the study of science diplomacy from a positive and contextualized approach stands out. Finally, recommended topics include the theory of international relations and foreign policy, and the history of science as a frame of reference for the study of ecosystems of science, technology, and innovation and the development of soft skills.",yes,yes,Latin America,None,None,None,None,,,,None,Latin America and the Caribbean,,,,None,Americas,{'Latin America and the Caribbean'},global_south

This means that it can only rely on persuasion to influence the international sphere and achieve its political objectives. One of the tools it has for this purpose is public diplomacy, which is diplomacy exercised through non-traditional means such as communication, art and culture. One branch of public diplomacy is science and technology diplomacy (S&T Diplomacy), which consists of collaboration in these areas with other nations to strengthen their international projection, as well as the dissemination of scientific knowledge and technology transfer between nations. S&T diplomacy has become a major focus for Japan of its diplomatic action since it launched the Society 5.0 project in 2016, which sought to revolutionize Japan‚Äôs economy, society and governance through technology. This S&T diplomacy has the potential to not only strengthen Japan‚Äôs external action, but also to transform its industries and research while it is transforming the infrastructures of Japan‚Äôs partner nations, like the construction of subway and high-speed rail networks in India.

Global Soft Power Index","Japan‚Äôs Science and Technology Diplomacy: Society 5.0 and its International ProjectionJapan is the third largest economy on the planet but lacks coercive capacity due to Article 9 of its Constitution, which prevents it from having an army and declaring war. This means that it can only rely on persuasion to influence the international sphere and achieve its political objectives. One of the tools it has for this purpose is public diplomacy, which is diplomacy exercised through non-traditional means such as communication, art and culture. One branch of public diplomacy is science and technology diplomacy (S&T Diplomacy), which consists of collaboration in these areas with other nations to strengthen their international projection, as well as the dissemination of scientific knowledge and technology transfer between nations. S&T diplomacy has become a major focus for Japan of its diplomatic action since it launched the Society 5.0 project in 2016, which sought to revolutionize Japan‚Äôs economy, society and governance through technology. This S&T diplomacy has the potential to not only strengthen Japan‚Äôs external action, but also to transform its industries and research while it is transforming the infrastructures of Japan‚Äôs partner nations, like the construction of subway and high-speed rail networks in India. This article will first analyze the theoretical framework of public diplomacy and science and technology diplomacy.

The European Commission embarked on this practice by the end of the last century and today there are twelve science counselors stationed in European Union (EU) delegations. All of them were interviewed, and filled out a short survey, for this study. This article documents the particular profile and missions of the EU's science counselors, to which no study has been devoted as such to date. The survey revealed their essential cross-cutting missions: promoting the research framework programs, and enhancing coordination with Member States' science attach√©s. This article draws on interviewees' statements and the existing literature in order to analyze and critically discuss the contribution of science counselors to the implementation of the EU's science diplomacy and public diplomacy.",yes,yes,European Union,None,None,None,None,,,,None,None,,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,{'Western Europe'},global_north

Harnden whose pedigree in the intelligence and training in architecture were an ideal match for leading the unit dedicated to exhibitions. The political sensitivity of the Mostra Atomica also required the intervention of the Italian Ministry of the Interior to guarantee safe mobility and secure shows. In every major town, American and British diplomats attended the local opening ceremony, while the very symbol of science diplomacy was Enrico Fermi, whose recorded message praised international cooperation. All in all, the USIS campaign promoting peaceful applications of nuclear physics was successful in reaching and involving Italian society. Visual and spatial aesthetics were particularly relevant: the geometrical design of the exposition rooms conveyed a strong sense of modernity that contrasted with the artistic heritage of Italian cities. The present article is based on archival files, newspaper reports, and photographs that document who was responsible for planning, setting up, and reporting this Cold War propaganda event.",yes,yes,Italy; United States of America; Britain; United Kingdom,United States of America; United Kingdom; Italy,Italy; United States of America; United Kingdom,None; None; None,None; None; None,Northern America; Northern Europe; Southern Europe,,Northern America; Northern Europe; Southern Europe,Northern America; Northern Europe; Southern Europe,Southern Europe; Northern America; Northern Europe,Americas; Europe,,Americas; Europe,Americas; Europe,Europe; Americas; Europe,{'Western Europe'},global_north

Leveraging science diplomacy to broaden the scope of engagements in Science, Technology and Innovation, India has launched numerous initiatives with Japan and France in diverse areas such as marine and earth science and technology, use and exploration of outer space and programmes to deal with challenges related to water.

Local government participates in national science diplomacy in four primary ways: twinned cities, intercity international organizations, foreign direct exchanges between cities, and city collaboration platforms. The representative event of polar science diplomacy was the conclusion of the Antarctic Treaty by 12 participating countries, which included the United States of America and the Soviet Union, during the International Geophysical Year. Subsequently, starting from nothing, China has achieved historic advances in its polar activities on small‚Äìlarge through polar science diplomacy. Shanghai is a gateway city via which China communicates with the Arctic and Antarctic, and it has been promoting China‚Äôs polar science diplomacy since the 1980s. The status of Shanghai as a national polar gateway city developed during the 1980s‚Äì1990s, and its foreign direct exchanges comprised mainly personnel visits.

Local government participates in national science diplomacy in four primary ways: twinned cities, intercity international organizations, foreign direct exchanges between cities, and city collaboration platforms. The representative event of polar science diplomacy was the conclusion of the Antarctic Treaty by 12 participating countries, which included the United States of America and the Soviet Union, during the International Geophysical Year. Subsequently, starting from nothing, China has achieved historic advances in its polar activities on small‚Äìlarge through polar science diplomacy. Shanghai is a gateway city via which China communicates with the Arctic and Antarctic, and it has been promoting China‚Äôs polar science diplomacy since the 1980s. The status of Shanghai as a national polar gateway city developed during the 1980s‚Äì1990s, and its foreign direct exchanges comprised mainly personnel visits. Since the beginning of 21st century, Shanghai has become an Asian polar gateway city and the forms of foreign direct exchanges have become increasingly diverse.

Not even diplomacy could escape change when Covid-19 hit the world in January 2020. Old approaches that have been in place for decades, even centuries, changed drastically, and diplomacy could not expect to continue as if nothing had happened. Approach to and application and operation of diplomacy has essentially been affected. In the era after Covid-19, countries and diplomats will still have to pay attention to these variables and will hardly be able to return to a previous era. Furthermore, domestic politics play an important role when considering strategic foreign policy decisions due to the threats that are expected or are already being carried out in connection with national security issues. Decisions on foreign affairs must therefore be evaluated in a certain domestic context because they develop mainly within national borders. In recent decades, the link between the two has become closer. The concepts of national interest, national security, domestic politics, and foreign policy have now become even more intertwined. Consequently, the question arises involuntarily: how are diplomats prepared and trained for this new world. Nowadays, diplomats are expected to be international advisers. Geopolitical views and applications have become more and more important, and the world is more interconnected than ever before. Understanding the global system is an inevitable requirement. The era requires people who can make difficult decisions and who will not worry about fine protocol rules being strictly enforced and adhered to anymore. These international advisers are now more than ever involved and instrumental in decision-making processes of peace and national security. This interdisciplinary role that these advisers must play is a challenging one that requires skilful dynamics. Contemporary diplomacy is changing at an unprecedented pace and is characterised by new role players, new issues, and new responsibilities. Multilateralism, which was the key to diplomacy since World War II has only gained momentum in the last 30 years, and with Covid-19, the importance of multilateral diplomacy was reaffirmed. In the span of two years, Covid-19 has revealed itself as a great equaliser, proving how interdependent the whole world really is. Covid-19 has unequivocally proved that the future of diplomacy is multilaterally driven. In addition, Covid-19 prevents personal contact and meetings, but foreign policymakers have been forced to adapt to a new digital norm. That digital revolution not only makes a wealth of information available, but also increases the speed at which decisions must be made. Diplomats similarly benefit from gathering and sharing knowledge, and this knowledge is made available at an unprecedented rate and needs to be managed. Knowledge management is the efficient handling of information and resources within a particular organisation. Knowledge diplomacy and a knowledge management system are both important because they increase the effectiveness of an institution's decision-making ability and ensure that all employees have access to overall expertise within the organisation. Knowledge management is consequently the conscious process of defining, structuring, retaining, and sharing knowledge and experience of employees within an organisation. The term knowledge diplomacy is becoming more and more popular and is used in different ways. Knowledge diplomacy, therefore, understands the role that international higher education, research, and innovation can play in strengthening relations between states. The impact of technology on the practice of diplomacy in the time of Covid-19 also inevitably emphasised the growing importance of conducting diplomacy digitally. Diplomats need to take a proactive approach to digitisation and acquire the skills needed to further promote domestic diplomacy through digital platforms as an important new component of future public diplomacy. The fight against the emergence of digital disinformation must, due to the nature of the decidedly negative implications of fake news, also receive pertinent attention. The subject of cyber security is most important and may not be ignored. Science diplomacy has become increasingly important. Another important aspect that diplomats should actively consider is how corporations continue to grow in their ability to practise public diplomacy. States are no longer the only international role players in the ever-growing diplomatic scene. Therefore, in order not to run the risk of becoming an endangered activity - which may become increasingly irrelevant because of increasing technological advances - diplomatic representation in the digital age must be intensified in order to increase diplomatic engagement and become a critical tool in an era of complex interdependence and globalisation. The number of role players involved in foreign affairs and diplomacy in one way or another has increased tremendously in recent decades. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more the world changes, and the challenge for diplomats is to manage these changes. The role of China and Russia in following their own world vision is an aspect of growing importance and demands constant vigilance.","corporate diplomacy | Covid-19 | digital diplomacy | digital technology | domestic policies | foreign affairs | geopolitical relations | knowledge diplomacy | knowledge management | multilateral diplomacy, science diplomacy",0,0,,,,undefined,,,,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

Between International Scientific Cooperation and Science DiplomacyThe chapter considers the role played by the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) within the concept of science diplomacy. It is argued that states still dominate Arctic science diplomacy as an area of regional governance, and non-state actors like IASC are playing only secondary or even utilitarian roles. Nevertheless, it is shown¬†how IASC is consequently developing its potential and trying to respond to the global interests in the region and the increasing demand for scientific knowledge related to the changing Arctic. This study suggests that the non-state actors in the Arctic region are becoming more effective, flexible and often better prepared to respond to specific, sectoral or sub-regional needs, which in times of climate change assure them an important position and promising perspective for the future.",yes,yes,Arctic ,None,Arctic,None,Arctic,,,,None,Arctic,,,,None,Arctic,{'Eastern Europe'},global_north

There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and cooperation with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia. This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stakeholders and key forms of Russia‚Äôs ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the implementation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD. These platforms include both national platforms (the international forum ‚ÄúThe Arctic: The Territory of Dialogue‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Arctic: Present and Future‚Äù) and the active use of international platforms (‚ÄúArctic Frontiers,‚Äù ‚ÄúPolar Circle,‚Äù and ‚ÄúArctic Science Summit Week‚Äù) and organizations such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS).",Arctic | Arctic council | Arctic strategies | Foreign policy | Public diplomacy | Science diplomacy,2,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,RSF,22-28-01287,Russian Science Foundation,Russian Federation,Eastern Europe,Europe,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

Association of Polar Early Career Scientists","RUSSIA‚ÄôS ARCTIC SCIENCE DIPLOMACY: THEORY AND PRACTICEArctic science diplomacy (ASD) is both a relatively new topic and an acute issue in Russian academic and political circles. There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and cooperation with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia. This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stakeholders and key forms of Russia‚Äôs ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the implementation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD. These platforms include both national platforms (the international forum ‚ÄúThe Arctic: The Territory of Dialogue‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Arctic: Present and Future‚Äù) and the active use of international platforms (‚ÄúArctic Frontiers,‚Äù ‚ÄúPolar Circle,‚Äù and ‚ÄúArctic Science Summit Week‚Äù) and organizations such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS).",yes,yes,Russian Federation; Arctic ,Russian Federation,Russian Federation; Arctic,None,None; Arctic,Eastern Europe,,Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe; Arctic,Europe,,Europe,Europe,Europe; Arctic,{'Eastern Europe'},global_north

The empirical study, based on archival research and the oral histories of key participants, also brings to light how problems of the human environment were conceived of and shaped by Swedish scientists and diplomats during this embryonic moment of global environmental governance. Through analysis of some of the public pronouncements and key documents drafted during the first phase of the Swedish initiative, the article further considers the role of popular science as a style of science communication that is particularly relevant in the realm of environmental diplomacy.",yes,yes,Sweden,Sweden,Sweden ,None,None,Northern Europe,,Northern Europe,Northern Europe,Northern Europe,Europe,,Europe,Europe,Europe,{'Northern Europe'},global_north

Moscow will probably try to make the Arctic Council's budget, including specific project budgets, more transparent and systemized. The Russian presidency aims to make the role of permanent participants and observers in the Council's activities more visible. At the same time, Moscow will avoid its former claims to transform the Council from an intergovernmental forum to a full-fledged international organization and bring military security problematique to the Council's agenda.

How has Russia's role evolved? What have been some of the main issues, agreements, disagreements, challenges and problems? What is Moscow's agenda during the Russian Council chairmanship in 2021‚Äì2023? The author identifies the following priorities for Russia's Arctic Council presidential agenda: climate change action; sustainable socioeconomic and environmental development; social cohesiveness and connectivity in the region; indigenous peoples; conservation of biodiversity; science diplomacy; Council's partial institutional reform. Moscow will probably try to make the Arctic Council's budget, including specific project budgets, more transparent and systemized. The Russian presidency aims to make the role of permanent participants and observers in the Council's activities more visible. At the same time, Moscow will avoid its former claims to transform the Council from an intergovernmental forum to a full-fledged international organization and bring military security problematique to the Council's agenda. Russia's chairmanship will try to strengthen the Arctic Council's role in asserting regional stewardship by responding to the challenges of a rapidly changing Arctic and the increasingly more integrated policy frameworks from local to global scales.",yes,yes,Russian Federation; Arctic ,Russian Federation,Russian Federation; Arctic,None,None; Arctic,Eastern Europe,,Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe; Arctic,Europe,,Europe,Europe,Europe; Arctic,{'Eastern Europe'},global_north

A recent initiative was launched for establishing the South-East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies (SEEIIST), a pan European research infrastructure (RI) which will provide a cutting-edge technology for (a) radiotherapy treatment with accelerated protons and ions and (b) multidisciplinary fundamental research involving accelerated ion beams. To justify the initiative for building the SEEIIST facility for cancer treatment, a study was conducted to estimate the time progress of the cancer incidence and mortality due to cancer in the countries of the SEE region. Methods and materials. The demography and the economic development of the SEE region were studied in relation to their emigration rate (brain drain). Time development of the incidence and mortality were studied for the SEE countries from the data available at Globocan of the IARC@WHO. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries' cancer datasheets from the World Health Organization (WHO). The top ten cancers were presented for the SEE countries and for the region as a whole. Results. From the available data it is evident that the incidence and the mortality, both grow with time in the SEE region, unlike in the developed European countries chosen for reference, where the mortality declines with time. The occurrence of breaking points in curves mortality vs. time is evident for all the analyzed SEE countries. Many of these points coincide with changes in the societal aspects (security, politics and/or economy). Conclusion. The emerging research infrastructure SEEIIST will mitigate the brain drain from SEE, and contribute in overcoming the historical friction in the turbulent Balkan region, offering research opportunities in many fields related to accelerated ions, foster, research, innovation and knowledge transfer, facilitate radiational therapy with particles to the cancer patients of the SEE region, reducing the growing cancer mortality, thereby. SEEIIST will be developed as a strong commitment of the SEE countries' governments and common effort in science diplomacy of the international community. The central research facility will be based in one of the ten SEE countries. In parallel with developing the principal RI, several SEEIIST HUBs and NETWORKs will be developed for different SEE countries in support to the SEEIIST sustainability. To provide sustainability of the SEEIIST RI, a GREEN energy HUB (Green power plant for powering SEEIIST) will be set. Also, an IT HUB (providing big data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence for SEEIIST), Imaging HUB (developing novel imaging solutions for ion therapy for SEEIIST), etc. Furthermore, several combined SEE and western European networks will be established, such as the Training network, Radiobiology Network, Network of Oncologists, Network of Veterinary scientists, with their central coordination offices located in different SEE countries, with the objective to start joint research related primarily to the cancer treatment but also to other research disciplines.",Balkans | Brain Drain | Breaking Points | Cancer epidemiology | Cancer in SEE region | Cancer Incidence | Cancer Mortality | Depopulation | Emigration | Science and diplomacy | SEEIIST,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,30-CE-0838742/00-87,,,,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

The project aims to analyze the various practices of science diplomacy in the key periods of history, to compare the experience of different countries. In the article, several participants of the project formulate their idea of the phenomenon of science diplomacy. Professor of the University of Le Havre (France) P.-B. Ruffini focuses on the main aspects of science diplomacy, characterizing it as an innovative concept of the 21st century, able to withstand global challenges, and showing that science diplomacy is a phenomenon much wider than the cooperation of scientists from around the world. Scientific director of the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Academician Alexander Chubaryan writes about the significant Russian contribution to the development of science diplomacy, drawing on various examples from the field of humanitarian cooperation.

The project aims to analyze the various practices of science diplomacy in the key periods of history, to compare the experience of different countries. In the article, several participants of the project formulate their idea of the phenomenon of science diplomacy. Professor of the University of Le Havre (France) P.-B. Ruffini focuses on the main aspects of science diplomacy, characterizing it as an innovative concept of the 21st century, able to withstand global challenges, and showing that science diplomacy is a phenomenon much wider than the cooperation of scientists from around the world. Scientific director of the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Academician Alexander Chubaryan writes about the significant Russian contribution to the development of science diplomacy, drawing on various examples from the field of humanitarian cooperation. Professor of the Sorbonne P. Griset, using the example of Soviet-French cooperation during the Cold War, shows the mechanism for the practical implementation of the elements of science diplomacy in life.

Countries engage in science diplomacy to access and promote knowledge, as well as influence public opinion. Despite the rising interest in science diplomacy, there is very little research on how science diplomacy can be utilized to tackle global challenges such as climate change. This paper aims to bring developing countries in front and show how science and technology cooperation among developing countries and between developing and developed countries can address climate change problems. Looking from a science and technology policy lens and highlighting the difference between science diplomacy and epistemic communities, we investigate structured government attempts in initiating cooperation toward specific ends.

Countries engage in science diplomacy to access and promote knowledge, as well as influence public opinion. Despite the rising interest in science diplomacy, there is very little research on how science diplomacy can be utilized to tackle global challenges such as climate change. This paper aims to bring developing countries in front and show how science and technology cooperation among developing countries and between developing and developed countries can address climate change problems. Looking from a science and technology policy lens and highlighting the difference between science diplomacy and epistemic communities, we investigate structured government attempts in initiating cooperation toward specific ends.

Their peoples are also among the first to be widely affected by global changes such as land degradation and climate change. Yet drylands are a source of many social and technical innovations, globally, as well as in Australia. As a major developed dryland nation, Australia has previously played a major role in extending these innovations to the rest of the world.

Dryland Information Hub","Commentary: On the under-valuing of Australia's expertise in drylands research and practice globallyGlobal drylands are a significant driver of earth system processes that affect the world's common resources such as the climate. Their peoples are also among the first to be widely affected by global changes such as land degradation and climate change. Yet drylands are a source of many social and technical innovations, globally, as well as in Australia. As a major developed dryland nation, Australia has previously played a major role in extending these innovations to the rest of the world. The nation has reaped reputational and commercial benefits through major research and practice contributions to dryland agriculture, water management and governance, remote area services, indigenous partnerships, dryland monitoring systems, and 'desert knowledge' innovation. Australian researchers continue to contribute to various relevant international processes, yet recognition and support for this within Australia has dropped off markedly in recent years.

For example, in a number of EHEA countries the adherence of academic freedom has deteriorated since 2010. In addition, various studies have suggested a decreasing level of political commitment to Europeanisation of higher education in a growing number of countries. Achieving progress in the coming period in this key part of the EHEA's objectives is difficult also as a result of the problems the overall process of European integration faces. For example, Brexit, the rise of anti-EU political parties and movements, and growing disagreements among EU member states on the key ideas and principles underlying European integration are posing serious challenges for Europe's way forward in higher education collaboration. In this chapter, we will discuss a number of the challenges facing, directly or indirectly, the EHEA. We will start with a discussion of the importance of the rise of science diplomacy for the EHEA, being a consequence of the growing connection between foreign affairs and the higher education & science policy areas. Next, we will analyse the growing intra-European political tensions, with a number of EHEA countries not adhering to basic European values and principles concerning liberal democracy and open societies. Further, we will examine relevant trends in EU-funded higher education collaboration within the EHEA, with special attention for the European University Initiative. Finally, the discussions and analyses presented in the chapter lead to proposing two complementary EHEA trajectories for the coming period, the first implying a move away from the geographical focus on Europe, the second including only those countries that adhere to promoting academic freedom, institutional autonomy and other basic values and principles.

Fundamental reforms","Quo Vadis EHEA: Balancing structural continuation and political varietyWhile the EHEA has achieved its goal to reduce structural barriers for student and staff mobility, the situation is different when it comes to the realization of the agreed upon promotion of basic values and principles. For example, in a number of EHEA countries the adherence of academic freedom has deteriorated since 2010. In addition, various studies have suggested a decreasing level of political commitment to Europeanisation of higher education in a growing number of countries. Achieving progress in the coming period in this key part of the EHEA's objectives is difficult also as a result of the problems the overall process of European integration faces. For example, Brexit, the rise of anti-EU political parties and movements, and growing disagreements among EU member states on the key ideas and principles underlying European integration are posing serious challenges for Europe's way forward in higher education collaboration. In this chapter, we will discuss a number of the challenges facing, directly or indirectly, the EHEA. We will start with a discussion of the importance of the rise of science diplomacy for the EHEA, being a consequence of the growing connection between foreign affairs and the higher education & science policy areas. Next, we will analyse the growing intra-European political tensions, with a number of EHEA countries not adhering to basic European values and principles concerning liberal democracy and open societies. Further, we will examine relevant trends in EU-funded higher education collaboration within the EHEA, with special attention for the European University Initiative. Finally, the discussions and analyses presented in the chapter lead to proposing two complementary EHEA trajectories for the coming period, the first implying a move away from the geographical focus on Europe, the second including only those countries that adhere to promoting academic freedom, institutional autonomy and other basic values and principles. Both trajectories take as a starting-point that the EHEA is in need of fundamental reforms.",yes,yes,Europe; European Union,None,None; None,None,None; None,,,,None,None; None,,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe; Europe ,{'Northern Europe'},global_north

The author defines the research, economic and political interests of the Spanish state in the Arctic, and also defines the main achievements and results. Great emphasis is placed on the importance of the scientific presence of Spain in the polar region, which allowed the kingdom to gain access to various international associations and institutions related to the Arctic. The main ideas of this study are the desire to show the Spanish Arctic policy as a successful version of the implementation of soft power, conducted through the concept of scientific diplomacy. The second important aspect is the relationship of the Arctic research process with the European integration process and Madrid's desire to combine the efforts of the European Union in the development and implementation of the Arctic strategy. Such actions find understanding among countries such as France, Italy and Poland.",yes,yes,Spain; Arctic; France; Italy; Poland; Polar Region; Antarctica; European Union,Antarctica; Poland; Italy; Spain; France,Spain; Arctic; France; Italy; Poland; Antarctica; None,None; None; None; None; None,None; Arctic; None; None; None; Antarctica; None,Antarctica; Eastern Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe,Antarctica,Antarctica; Eastern Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe; Antarctica,Eastern Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe,Southern Europe; Arctic; Western Europe; Southern Europe; Eastern Europe; Antarctica; None,Antarctica; Europe,Antarctica; Europe,Antarctica; Europe; Antarctica; Europe,Europe; Europe,Europe; Arctic; Europe; Europe; Europe; Antarctica; Europe,{'Eastern Europe'},global_north

Lessons from the Polar regions reveal theory, methods and skills of informed decisionmaking that operate across a ‚Äòcontinuum of urgencies‚Äô from security to sustainability time scales at the levels of governments, peoples and our world. Such integration has emerged naturally with the International Polar Years (IPY), Antarctic Treaty System and Arctic Council in the context of international law across decades and centuries.

Scientists, being ‚Äòneutral‚Äô representatives of their countries, are looking for answers to the global challenges of our time, common to all of humanity. As Anton Chekhov said: ‚ÄòThere is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what‚Äôs national is no longer a science‚Äô. Diplomats are people whose main task is to promote the interests and values of their country on the world stages; therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the development of scientific diplomacy in various countries. As a result of the study, the authors concluded that scientific diplomacy always reflects the interests of a state and therefore differs from international scientific cooperation. At the same time, there are many areas of common interest between science and diplomacy. Diplomats are interested in the key values of science ‚Äì the universality and neutrality of knowledge, and they, in turn, can contribute to the activities of scientists. The authors conclude that there are many examples in history when scientific problems reached the level of diplomatic relations, and sometimes acted as their catalyst. On the contrary, diplomats often stimulated cooperation between countries in research, science, and technology.

- Scientific diplomacy","Global science diplomacy in the digital age: Socio-economic and legal layout of international scientific cooperationConventional diplomacy has always relied on scientific expertise. Scientists, being ‚Äòneutral‚Äô representatives of their countries, are looking for answers to the global challenges of our time, common to all of humanity. As Anton Chekhov said: ‚ÄòThere is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what‚Äôs national is no longer a science‚Äô. Diplomats are people whose main task is to promote the interests and values of their country on the world stages; therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the development of scientific diplomacy in various countries. As a result of the study, the authors concluded that scientific diplomacy always reflects the interests of a state and therefore differs from international scientific cooperation. At the same time, there are many areas of common interest between science and diplomacy. Diplomats are interested in the key values of science ‚Äì the universality and neutrality of knowledge, and they, in turn, can contribute to the activities of scientists. The authors conclude that there are many examples in history when scientific problems reached the level of diplomatic relations, and sometimes acted as their catalyst. On the contrary, diplomats often stimulated cooperation between countries in research, science, and technology. In this regard, Kazakhstan is interested in the best practices of developed countries in the field of scientific diplomacy.",yes,yes,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan,None,None,Central Asia,,Central Asia,Central Asia,Central Asia,Asia,,Asia,Asia,Asia,{'Central Asia'},global_south

The interest in examining the Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RTD&I) structures and policies in this country stems from the particularity of the above research governance structure in combination with the strong international commitment and involvement of its Transport related industries and the private sector. It also stems from the observation that Japan is a relatively speaking ‚Äúslow mover‚Äù when it comes to institutional or cultural change as well as a relatively ‚Äúclosed‚Äù system, regarding RTD&I. Its official efforts to embrace new thinking, seem in conflict with a systemic resistance to change and this may create sub-optimal or even contradictory policies and programs that could compromise Japan‚Äôs efforts to regain its RTD&I prominence globally and in East Asia. This chapter examines all these issues in a systematic and thorough way starting with an examination of the background to economic change in Japan and the emergence of its Science and Technology Basic Plans . It then proceeds to examine the Japanese research governance and funding system and its main international RTD&I collaboration policies and activities. It also focuses on transport research and examines its place in the overall Japanese RTD&I system, its principal stakeholders, and gives specific examples of current Japanese international RTD&I cooperation efforts in the transport sector. The Chapter concludes that even if Japan is able to establish an optimal RTD&I international cooperation policy, there are a number of factors that will continue to slow its ability to compete on the RTD&I front. These include an aging population that is highly dependent on social services and thus absorbing many public funding resources; the ‚Äúinsular‚Äù culture in the country that is biased against significant participation by foreign scientists; the corresponding reluctance of foreign scientists to relocate to Japan; the growing labour costs; and an apparent reluctance to encourage foreign investment for RTD&I in Japan. In the field of transport, Japan (especially the Japanese private sector) is making considerable progress in establishing international transportation RTD&I collaborations with Europe, the United States, and other countries of East Asia. A major sign of this progress is Japan‚Äôs so called ST&I diplomacy relationships primarily with other East Asian governments. This maybe driven by competition considerations and the potential for finding new markets but it is still a very significant ‚Äúopening‚Äù of the Japanese RTD&I system to the outside world.

The data, drawn from available sources and memoirs, highlights the phenomenological approach in people-to-people interaction to analyse paths, processes and timeline dependence in such cooperation. The Weberian model of generalization and the path dependency theory of constructing an ideal type were used as the study's theoretical frameworks.

The ASTP can be viewed through the lens of science diplomacy (SD). The data, drawn from available sources and memoirs, highlights the phenomenological approach in people-to-people interaction to analyse paths, processes and timeline dependence in such cooperation. The Weberian model of generalization and the path dependency theory of constructing an ideal type were used as the study's theoretical frameworks. An ideal type of SD is viewed not as universal, but as a heuristic device that can be contrasted and compared with other recognized cases of SD. The significance of utilizing an ideal type of SD is to maintain mechanisms and networks effectively between countries through science and technology-related joint projects when political relations are strained or limited.",yes,yes,Russian Federation; Soviet Union; United States of America,United States of America; Russian Federation,Russian Federation; United States of America ,None; None,None; None,Northern America; Eastern Europe,,Northern America; Eastern Europe,Northern America; Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe; Northern America,Americas; Europe,,Americas; Europe,Americas; Europe,Europe; Americas,{'Eastern Asia'},global_north

In order to achieve these goals, the author provides an analysis of functioning of the French national system of economic diplomacy, which since 2012 has undergone a process of restructuring, aimed at enhancing the role of the ministry of foreign affairs in regulating of foreign economic activities. In fact, this reform constituted the government's reaction to the financial and economic crisis of the Eurozone in 2011-2012. The article examines the key dimensions of the current reform: activation of the ""French teams""; personal involvement of the Minister of foreign affairs into economic diplomacy issues; promoting French high technologies and innovations on the world markets; diversification of foreign investment inflows in favor of developing countries; support of the foreign economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises; introduction of a facilitated visa regime for businessmen from countries considered strategic partners. The article casts light upon the recent structural transformations in the economic diplomacy service, especially, on the establishment of the Directorate for French companies and the world economy at the MFA, introduction of the new positions dealing with foreign economic activities, as well as organizations of events aimed at promoting economic ties. It also contains preliminary results of the reforms depicted by the dynamics of FDI flows, number and price of contracts between French companies and foreign investors, job growth on joint enterprises, number of French business units penetrating foreign markets. The author outlines the trend of the MFA playing a dominant role in the elaboration of the general foreign economic strategy alongside tactical policy-making.

The article examines the key dimensions of the current reform: activation of the ""French teams""; personal involvement of the Minister of foreign affairs into economic diplomacy issues; promoting French high technologies and innovations on the world markets; diversification of foreign investment inflows in favor of developing countries; support of the foreign economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises; introduction of a facilitated visa regime for businessmen from countries considered strategic partners. The article casts light upon the recent structural transformations in the economic diplomacy service, especially, on the establishment of the Directorate for French companies and the world economy at the MFA, introduction of the new positions dealing with foreign economic activities, as well as organizations of events aimed at promoting economic ties. It also contains preliminary results of the reforms depicted by the dynamics of FDI flows, number and price of contracts between French companies and foreign investors, job growth on joint enterprises, number of French business units penetrating foreign markets. The author outlines the trend of the MFA playing a dominant role in the elaboration of the general foreign economic strategy alongside tactical policy-making. On the example of such an important field as scientific diplomacy, the author illustrates that the reform's approaches are also being implemented in specific functional diplomacy tracks. However, taking into account the ongoing reformation process, evaluating its overall results may be considered somewhat untimely.",yes,yes,France,France,France ,None,None,Western Europe,,Western Europe,Western Europe,Western Europe,Europe,,Europe,Europe,Europe,{'Eastern Europe'},global_north

The complex connectedness of modern society and politics compels us to investigate the pattern of interconnections among actors who inhabit social and political spaces. Gabriella Pa√°r-J√°kli‚Äôs study aims to advance theory and practice by examining the networks used by specialists in North America and Europe to achieve their policy goals in the area of science and technology. Her book suggests that to overcome policy problems transnationally, three critical factors should be considered. First, as science and technology policy becomes increasingly critical to resolving global issues, it should be regarded as an integral element of the foreign policy process. Second, as liberal international relations theory argues, the increasing role of NGOs must be taken seriously alongside states as vital agents of policy reform. Third, as transatlantic relations remain center to maintaining the global order, they must be reconsidered. Paar-Jakli assesses the role of digital networks as facilitators of regional cooperation.

Interaction","Networked governance and transatlantic relations: Building bridges through science diplomacyIn today‚Äôs complex and interconnected world, scholars of international relations seek to better understand challenges spurred by intensified global communication and interaction. The complex connectedness of modern society and politics compels us to investigate the pattern of interconnections among actors who inhabit social and political spaces. Gabriella Pa√°r-J√°kli‚Äôs study aims to advance theory and practice by examining the networks used by specialists in North America and Europe to achieve their policy goals in the area of science and technology. Her book suggests that to overcome policy problems transnationally, three critical factors should be considered. First, as science and technology policy becomes increasingly critical to resolving global issues, it should be regarded as an integral element of the foreign policy process. Second, as liberal international relations theory argues, the increasing role of NGOs must be taken seriously alongside states as vital agents of policy reform. Third, as transatlantic relations remain center to maintaining the global order, they must be reconsidered. Paar-Jakli assesses the role of digital networks as facilitators of regional cooperation. Utilizing various techniques of social network analysis, her research indicates an active and structurally discernible network in cyberspace among transatlantic organizations, and demonstrates the role of virtual networks as facilitators of cooperative arrangements in transatlantic relations.

Design/methodology/approach: Employing an institutional perspective, the paper is based on interviews in China and the USA and reviews of government documents and press reports. Findings: Owing to the impacts of the Cultural Revolution on Chinese S&T, the relationship is highly asymmetrical when it began in the late 1970s.

Other proposed actions include increasing USAID support that builds S&T capacity in developing countries, and orienting other departments and agencies S&T developing country programs to support the development priorities of the host countries. Another proposal would establish a new U.S. government organization, modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) known for its risktaking and innovation, called the Development Applications Research Institute. (DARI) to develop and apply innovative technologies to development problems. In all of these efforts, Congress might wish to consider enhancing the prominence of the STAS, and coordination among S&T leaders at OES, STAS, and OSTP.",yes,yes,United States of America,United States of America,United States of America,None,None,Northern America,,Northern America,Northern America,Northern America,Americas,,Americas,Americas,Americas,{'Northern America'},global_north
