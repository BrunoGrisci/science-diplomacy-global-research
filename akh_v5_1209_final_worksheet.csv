Using insights from three strands of literature, we compare four IGSOs with Southern participation: the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the Square Kilometer Array, and the African Lightsource. We show that countries of the Global South pursue a multitude of political and scientific objectives in IGSOs, ranging from capacity-building to casting off political isolation.

- IGSO maturity","Science diplomacy from the Global South: The case of intergovernmental science organizationsIntergovernmental science organizations (IGSOs) address many challenges of the 21st century. Several countries of the Global South have joined established IGSOs or have created new ones. Yet we know little about their interests in IGSOs. Our study addresses this blind spot by investigating which objectives Southern actors pursue in IGSOs and under which conditions they are likely to achieve their objectives. Using insights from three strands of literature, we compare four IGSOs with Southern participation: the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the Square Kilometer Array, and the African Lightsource. We show that countries of the Global South pursue a multitude of political and scientific objectives in IGSOs, ranging from capacity-building to casting off political isolation. Moreover, we demonstrate that Southern countries have varying chances of attaining these objectives, depending on their scientific community, domestic politics, industrial capacities and in some cases geographic location as well as an IGSO's maturity.",yes,yes,Global South; Africa,None,None,None,None,,,,None,None,,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,"{'Northern Europe', 'Northern America', 'Western Europe'}",global_north

This means that it can only rely on persuasion to influence the international sphere and achieve its political objectives. One of the tools it has for this purpose is public diplomacy, which is diplomacy exercised through non-traditional means such as communication, art and culture. One branch of public diplomacy is science and technology diplomacy (S&T Diplomacy), which consists of collaboration in these areas with other nations to strengthen their international projection, as well as the dissemination of scientific knowledge and technology transfer between nations. S&T diplomacy has become a major focus for Japan of its diplomatic action since it launched the Society 5.0 project in 2016, which sought to revolutionize Japan’s economy, society and governance through technology. This S&T diplomacy has the potential to not only strengthen Japan’s external action, but also to transform its industries and research while it is transforming the infrastructures of Japan’s partner nations, like the construction of subway and high-speed rail networks in India. This article will first analyze the theoretical framework of public diplomacy and science and technology diplomacy.

Global Soft Power Index","Japan’s Science and Technology Diplomacy: Society 5.0 and its International ProjectionJapan is the third largest economy on the planet but lacks coercive capacity due to Article 9 of its Constitution, which prevents it from having an army and declaring war. This means that it can only rely on persuasion to influence the international sphere and achieve its political objectives. One of the tools it has for this purpose is public diplomacy, which is diplomacy exercised through non-traditional means such as communication, art and culture. One branch of public diplomacy is science and technology diplomacy (S&T Diplomacy), which consists of collaboration in these areas with other nations to strengthen their international projection, as well as the dissemination of scientific knowledge and technology transfer between nations. S&T diplomacy has become a major focus for Japan of its diplomatic action since it launched the Society 5.0 project in 2016, which sought to revolutionize Japan’s economy, society and governance through technology. This S&T diplomacy has the potential to not only strengthen Japan’s external action, but also to transform its industries and research while it is transforming the infrastructures of Japan’s partner nations, like the construction of subway and high-speed rail networks in India. This article will first analyze the theoretical framework of public diplomacy and science and technology diplomacy. Next, Japan’s public diplomacy will be studied by comparing The Soft Power 30 and Global Soft Power Index. Finally, Japanese science and technology diplomacy will be analyzed by assessing the initiatives contained in the Japanese Society 5.0 project.",yes,yes,Japan; India,Japan; India,Japan; India,None; None,None; None,Eastern Asia; Southern Asia,,Eastern Asia; Southern Asia,Eastern Asia; Southern Asia,Eastern Asia; Southern Asia,Asia,,Asia,Asia,Asia; Asia,{'Southern Europe'},global_north

Yeast molecular genetics was the field where I moved the first steps during my Ph.D. experience in the United States, and molecular nutrition/nutritional systems biology is the broad scientific area of my professional lifetime since returning to Italy. Walking backwards the route of Darwinian evolution, I spent the last decade of my life in science studying food microbiology, until a final sharp turn led me to conclude my career within the trans-disciplinary field of science diplomacy at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the verge of retirement it is hard to say whether this non-linear path had more pros or cons, but it leaves me with the rewarding feeling of having learned a lot, and I must thank for this all the people I met and teamed with along the way. Being them mentors, collaborators, young fellows or students, sharing part of my path with them has always provided precious take-home lessons.

- Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs","From Molecular Biology to Science Diplomacy: A Long and Winding RoadAs young kids we view science as a fascinating world of breakthrough discoveries, and it was probably this childish idea that drove me into choosing biological sciences as a field of study. Like all aspects of our existence, however, life in science can take unpredictable paths and my personal journey through it was hardly linear, mostly as a consequence of close encounters with unavoidable obstacles, and partly reflecting my constant desire for new challenges. Yeast molecular genetics was the field where I moved the first steps during my Ph.D. experience in the United States, and molecular nutrition/nutritional systems biology is the broad scientific area of my professional lifetime since returning to Italy. Walking backwards the route of Darwinian evolution, I spent the last decade of my life in science studying food microbiology, until a final sharp turn led me to conclude my career within the trans-disciplinary field of science diplomacy at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the verge of retirement it is hard to say whether this non-linear path had more pros or cons, but it leaves me with the rewarding feeling of having learned a lot, and I must thank for this all the people I met and teamed with along the way. Being them mentors, collaborators, young fellows or students, sharing part of my path with them has always provided precious take-home lessons. Regrettably, I felt all along that the outcomes of my hard work were more valued and supported outside than within my own institution.",yes,yes,United States of America; Italy,United States of America; Italy,United States of America; Italy,None; None,None; None,Northern America; Southern Europe,,Northern America; Southern Europe,Northern America; Southern Europe,Northern America; Southern Europe,Americas; Europe,,Americas; Europe,Americas; Europe,Americas; Europe,{'Southern Europe'},global_north

Some argue that there is a lack of empirical evidence to underpin the taxonomy's three science diplomacy dimensions. This particularly applies to the third dimension, science for diplomacy, and its effectiveness. Others criticise the taxonomy for painting the picture of compliant scientists who would discard their academic ideals to support foreign policy objectives.

Some argue that there is a lack of empirical evidence to underpin the taxonomy's three science diplomacy dimensions. This particularly applies to the third dimension, science for diplomacy, and its effectiveness. Others criticise the taxonomy for painting the picture of compliant scientists who would discard their academic ideals to support foreign policy objectives. Against the backdrop of these two points of criticism, this study investigates if scientists are willing to support political objectives through science collaborations.

International Partnerships (collaboration)","Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR): Showcases for making science diplomacyScience diplomacy can be defined as the use of scientific collaborations between countries to address joint problems and to build constructive international partnerships for delivering effective scientific advice for policy making. During the last 10 years, the Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR) has been active in finding ways to solve global Grand Challenges, particularly climate change and poor air quality in polluted megacities, and at the same time, better bridge research to international climate policy and science diplomacy processes. INAR has introduced Pan-Eurasian Experiment programme running since the year 2012 (www.atm.helsinki.fi/peex) to better address the scientific challenge to understand Atmosphere - Earth Surface - Biosphere interactions and feedbacks in the Northern Eurasian context. INAR has also launched a measurement concept called the Global Network of Stations Measuring Earth Surface and Atmosphere Interactions (GlobalSMEAR) and has hosted the European Centre of the International Eurasian Academy of Sciences since 2015. Most recently, INAR has coordinated the Arena for the gap analysis of the existing Arctic Science Co-Operations (AASCO), 2020-2021, to promote research with a holistic and integrated approach in understanding feedbacks and interactions globally and locally at the Arctic and outside the Arctic environments.",yes,yes,Arctic ,None,Arctic,None,Arctic,,,,None,Arctic,,,,None,Arctic,{'Northern Europe'},global_north

Not even diplomacy could escape change when Covid-19 hit the world in January 2020. Old approaches that have been in place for decades, even centuries, changed drastically, and diplomacy could not expect to continue as if nothing had happened. Approach to and application and operation of diplomacy has essentially been affected. In the era after Covid-19, countries and diplomats will still have to pay attention to these variables and will hardly be able to return to a previous era. Furthermore, domestic politics play an important role when considering strategic foreign policy decisions due to the threats that are expected or are already being carried out in connection with national security issues. Decisions on foreign affairs must therefore be evaluated in a certain domestic context because they develop mainly within national borders. In recent decades, the link between the two has become closer. The concepts of national interest, national security, domestic politics, and foreign policy have now become even more intertwined. Consequently, the question arises involuntarily: how are diplomats prepared and trained for this new world. Nowadays, diplomats are expected to be international advisers. Geopolitical views and applications have become more and more important, and the world is more interconnected than ever before. Understanding the global system is an inevitable requirement. The era requires people who can make difficult decisions and who will not worry about fine protocol rules being strictly enforced and adhered to anymore. These international advisers are now more than ever involved and instrumental in decision-making processes of peace and national security. This interdisciplinary role that these advisers must play is a challenging one that requires skilful dynamics. Contemporary diplomacy is changing at an unprecedented pace and is characterised by new role players, new issues, and new responsibilities. Multilateralism, which was the key to diplomacy since World War II has only gained momentum in the last 30 years, and with Covid-19, the importance of multilateral diplomacy was reaffirmed. In the span of two years, Covid-19 has revealed itself as a great equaliser, proving how interdependent the whole world really is. Covid-19 has unequivocally proved that the future of diplomacy is multilaterally driven. In addition, Covid-19 prevents personal contact and meetings, but foreign policymakers have been forced to adapt to a new digital norm. That digital revolution not only makes a wealth of information available, but also increases the speed at which decisions must be made. Diplomats similarly benefit from gathering and sharing knowledge, and this knowledge is made available at an unprecedented rate and needs to be managed. Knowledge management is the efficient handling of information and resources within a particular organisation. Knowledge diplomacy and a knowledge management system are both important because they increase the effectiveness of an institution's decision-making ability and ensure that all employees have access to overall expertise within the organisation. Knowledge management is consequently the conscious process of defining, structuring, retaining, and sharing knowledge and experience of employees within an organisation. The term knowledge diplomacy is becoming more and more popular and is used in different ways. Knowledge diplomacy, therefore, understands the role that international higher education, research, and innovation can play in strengthening relations between states. The impact of technology on the practice of diplomacy in the time of Covid-19 also inevitably emphasised the growing importance of conducting diplomacy digitally. Diplomats need to take a proactive approach to digitisation and acquire the skills needed to further promote domestic diplomacy through digital platforms as an important new component of future public diplomacy. The fight against the emergence of digital disinformation must, due to the nature of the decidedly negative implications of fake news, also receive pertinent attention. The subject of cyber security is most important and may not be ignored. Science diplomacy has become increasingly important. Another important aspect that diplomats should actively consider is how corporations continue to grow in their ability to practise public diplomacy. States are no longer the only international role players in the ever-growing diplomatic scene. Therefore, in order not to run the risk of becoming an endangered activity - which may become increasingly irrelevant because of increasing technological advances - diplomatic representation in the digital age must be intensified in order to increase diplomatic engagement and become a critical tool in an era of complex interdependence and globalisation. The number of role players involved in foreign affairs and diplomacy in one way or another has increased tremendously in recent decades. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more the world changes, and the challenge for diplomats is to manage these changes. The role of China and Russia in following their own world vision is an aspect of growing importance and demands constant vigilance.","corporate diplomacy | Covid-19 | digital diplomacy | digital technology | domestic policies | foreign affairs | geopolitical relations | knowledge diplomacy | knowledge management | multilateral diplomacy, science diplomacy",0,0,,,,undefined,,,,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

Not even diplomacy could escape change when Covid-19 hit the world in January 2020. Old approaches that have been in place for decades, even centuries, changed drastically, and diplomacy could not expect to continue as if nothing had happened. Approach to and application and operation of diplomacy has essentially been affected. In the era after Covid-19, countries and diplomats will still have to pay attention to these variables and will hardly be able to return to a previous era. Furthermore, domestic politics play an important role when considering strategic foreign policy decisions due to the threats that are expected or are already being carried out in connection with national security issues. Decisions on foreign affairs must therefore be evaluated in a certain domestic context because they develop mainly within national borders. In recent decades, the link between the two has become closer. The concepts of national interest, national security, domestic politics, and foreign policy have now become even more intertwined. Consequently, the question arises involuntarily: how are diplomats prepared and trained for this new world. Nowadays, diplomats are expected to be international advisers. Geopolitical views and applications have become more and more important, and the world is more interconnected than ever before. Understanding the global system is an inevitable requirement. The era requires people who can make difficult decisions and who will not worry about fine protocol rules being strictly enforced and adhered to anymore. These international advisers are now more than ever involved and instrumental in decision-making processes of peace and national security. This interdisciplinary role that these advisers must play is a challenging one that requires skilful dynamics. Contemporary diplomacy is changing at an unprecedented pace and is characterised by new role players, new issues, and new responsibilities. Multilateralism, which was the key to diplomacy since World War II has only gained momentum in the last 30 years, and with Covid-19, the importance of multilateral diplomacy was reaffirmed. In the span of two years, Covid-19 has revealed itself as a great equaliser, proving how interdependent the whole world really is. Covid-19 has unequivocally proved that the future of diplomacy is multilaterally driven. In addition, Covid-19 prevents personal contact and meetings, but foreign policymakers have been forced to adapt to a new digital norm. That digital revolution not only makes a wealth of information available, but also increases the speed at which decisions must be made. Diplomats similarly benefit from gathering and sharing knowledge, and this knowledge is made available at an unprecedented rate and needs to be managed. Knowledge management is the efficient handling of information and resources within a particular organisation. Knowledge diplomacy and a knowledge management system are both important because they increase the effectiveness of an institution's decision-making ability and ensure that all employees have access to overall expertise within the organisation. Knowledge management is consequently the conscious process of defining, structuring, retaining, and sharing knowledge and experience of employees within an organisation. The term knowledge diplomacy is becoming more and more popular and is used in different ways. Knowledge diplomacy, therefore, understands the role that international higher education, research, and innovation can play in strengthening relations between states.

However, there are issues jeopardizing cooperation between diplomats and scientists, and in order to gain insight into the nature of these problems and suggest ways to rectify the situation and so alleviate the struggle of both sides, the authors have conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with representatives of Russian-speaking academia and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The scientists interviewed have reported legal issues, as well as a lack of consular and visa information, as factors negatively affecting their decision to go abroad for working purposes; the so-called research diaspora is poorly consolidated, subverting efforts to coordinate Russian-speaking researchers outside Russia. The diplomats expressed regret over the absence of formal definitions for such terms as ‘researcher’ and ‘research diaspora’ which effectively hinders the identification of those eligible for diplomatic and consular support within the ‘diplomacy for science’ framework. The support itself is provided unevenly across Russian diplomatic establishments abroad, being dependent on the staffing situation and the Ambassador’s as well as senior diplomats’ personal interest in the matter. At the same time, both scholars and diplomats indicated difficulties in communicating with each other, caused by among other reasons a sense of mutual distrust. Based on the empirical data collected and analyzed, the authors have formulated a number of recommendations for decision-makers to bolster the country’s science diplomacy effort. To enhance consular and visa support, it is suggested that travel for the purposes of scientific exchange be designated as an independent visa category and ‘Scientist IDs’ introduced (similarly to ‘Fan IDs’). To engage more with the research diaspora, it is advisable to define what categories of researchers comprise the said group and offer them eased rules of entry and naturalization.

The project is built on the idea that science can help to overcome barriers and cultural differences within the common ground of science and research. SESAME's core ambition is to operate an international state-of-the-art synchrotron users' facility in the north of Amman that is accessible to scientists from all of its members: Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Palestine, Turkey and Jordan.

- Science diplomacy","SESAME - a synchrotron light source in the Middle East: An international research infrastructure in the makingSESAME (Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) is an international research centre located in Jordan. The centre was established in the late 1990s with the intention to foster scientific cooperation in a region of the world that has been torn by persistent conflicts. The project is built on the idea that science can help to overcome barriers and cultural differences within the common ground of science and research. SESAME's core ambition is to operate an international state-of-the-art synchrotron users' facility in the north of Amman that is accessible to scientists from all of its members: Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Palestine, Turkey and Jordan. Accordingly, SESAME has been often praised as a paramount example of science diplomacy. Our intention for this report was to investigate a concrete international research infrastructure with a specific science diplomacy interest. What were the enabling conditions for such a project to come into being and what keeps SESAME running? What were the challenges and obstacles? How does the composition of member states play into that? How is SESAME related to (and embedded in) the global synchrotron community, academia, researchers and political actors in the region and the world? Did the science diplomacy ambition behind the project turn out to be successful and how does it affect SESAME's future?",yes,yes,Cyprus; Egypt; Iran; Israel; Pakistan; Palestine; Turkey; Jordan,Egypt; Iran; Pakistan; Cyprus; Israel; Jordan; Palestine; Turkey,Cyprus; Egypt; Iran; Israel; Pakistan; Palestine; Turkey; Jordan,None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None,None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None,Northern Africa; Southern Asia; Western Asia,,Northern Africa; Southern Asia; Western Asia,Northern Africa; Southern Asia; Western Asia,Western Asia; Northern Africa; Southern Asia; Western Asia; Southern Asia; Western Asia; Western Asia; Western Asia,Africa; Asia,,Africa; Asia,Africa; Asia,Asia; Africa; Asia; Asia; Asia; Asia; Asia; Asia,{'Western Europe'},global_north

There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors.

The European Union has also implemented various programs with Central Asian countries. The research question is what are the goals and objectives of EU science and technology diplomacy in Kazakhstan? The results show that EU scientific diplomacy is pursued in two forms: scientific diplomacy based on technology and scientific diplomacy based on the humanities in Central Asia. For example, 4 to 7-year programs have been implemented in Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan include biology, genomics and biotechnology for health, information technologies, nanotechnology, knowledge-based multifunctional materials and new manufacturing processes and tools, air and space, food quality and safety.

The European Union has also implemented various programs with Central Asian countries. The research question is what are the goals and objectives of EU science and technology diplomacy in Kazakhstan? The results show that EU scientific diplomacy is pursued in two forms: scientific diplomacy based on technology and scientific diplomacy based on the humanities in Central Asia. For example, 4 to 7-year programs have been implemented in Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan include biology, genomics and biotechnology for health, information technologies, nanotechnology, knowledge-based multifunctional materials and new manufacturing processes and tools, air and space, food quality and safety. The main focus of the program is on Kazakhstan. The main objectives of these programs appear to monitor the country's nuclear activities with the aim of preventing nuclear proliferation via support from the model of neoliberal economic development, increase the capacity of civil society, and support the soft power of the union.

The course uses blended delivery, a flipped format, and modified mastery learning with a buffet approach to assign final grades. The course has been piloted for three semesters to a total of 35 dual-level (seniors and first year graduate) students pursuing a baccalaureate degree in environmental or civil engineering or a graduate degree in environmental or civil engineering. The course introduces the three pillars of “science diplomacy” as described in the New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy report published in 2010 by the Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, including: 1) science-in-diplomacy; 2) diplomacy-for-science; and 3) science-for-diplomacy. During the semester, students conduct policy analyses of case studies including: 1) the Lower Mekong River Initiative of the United States; 2) the Antarctic Treaty as described by the Royal Geographical Society; 3) the Make the Planet Great Again campaign of France; and 4) HIV/AIDS treatment in South Africa as described by Harvard Law School.

The course uses blended delivery, a flipped format, and modified mastery learning with a buffet approach to assign final grades. The course has been piloted for three semesters to a total of 35 dual-level (seniors and first year graduate) students pursuing a baccalaureate degree in environmental or civil engineering or a graduate degree in environmental or civil engineering. The course introduces the three pillars of “science diplomacy” as described in the New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy report published in 2010 by the Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, including: 1) science-in-diplomacy; 2) diplomacy-for-science; and 3) science-for-diplomacy. During the semester, students conduct policy analyses of case studies including: 1) the Lower Mekong River Initiative of the United States; 2) the Antarctic Treaty as described by the Royal Geographical Society; 3) the Make the Planet Great Again campaign of France; and 4) HIV/AIDS treatment in South Africa as described by Harvard Law School.

The main objective is to better understand how highly trained negotiators and diplomats reason, feel, and behave in complex negotiation processes under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity, and if interpersonal skills could be a predictor of a sound negotiating process. Our findings suggest that there is a variability in negotiation outcome that can be linked to an individual negotiator and it appears that a portion of this variability can be related specifically to negotiators' interpersonal skills rather than to other variables.

A recent initiative was launched for establishing the South-East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies (SEEIIST), a pan European research infrastructure (RI) which will provide a cutting-edge technology for (a) radiotherapy treatment with accelerated protons and ions and (b) multidisciplinary fundamental research involving accelerated ion beams. To justify the initiative for building the SEEIIST facility for cancer treatment, a study was conducted to estimate the time progress of the cancer incidence and mortality due to cancer in the countries of the SEE region. Methods and materials. The demography and the economic development of the SEE region were studied in relation to their emigration rate (brain drain). Time development of the incidence and mortality were studied for the SEE countries from the data available at Globocan of the IARC@WHO. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries' cancer datasheets from the World Health Organization (WHO). The top ten cancers were presented for the SEE countries and for the region as a whole. Results. From the available data it is evident that the incidence and the mortality, both grow with time in the SEE region, unlike in the developed European countries chosen for reference, where the mortality declines with time. The occurrence of breaking points in curves mortality vs. time is evident for all the analyzed SEE countries. Many of these points coincide with changes in the societal aspects (security, politics and/or economy). Conclusion. The emerging research infrastructure SEEIIST will mitigate the brain drain from SEE, and contribute in overcoming the historical friction in the turbulent Balkan region, offering research opportunities in many fields related to accelerated ions, foster, research, innovation and knowledge transfer, facilitate radiational therapy with particles to the cancer patients of the SEE region, reducing the growing cancer mortality, thereby. SEEIIST will be developed as a strong commitment of the SEE countries' governments and common effort in science diplomacy of the international community. The central research facility will be based in one of the ten SEE countries. In parallel with developing the principal RI, several SEEIIST HUBs and NETWORKs will be developed for different SEE countries in support to the SEEIIST sustainability. To provide sustainability of the SEEIIST RI, a GREEN energy HUB (Green power plant for powering SEEIIST) will be set. Also, an IT HUB (providing big data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence for SEEIIST), Imaging HUB (developing novel imaging solutions for ion therapy for SEEIIST), etc. Furthermore, several combined SEE and western European networks will be established, such as the Training network, Radiobiology Network, Network of Oncologists, Network of Veterinary scientists, with their central coordination offices located in different SEE countries, with the objective to start joint research related primarily to the cancer treatment but also to other research disciplines.",Balkans | Brain Drain | Breaking Points | Cancer epidemiology | Cancer in SEE region | Cancer Incidence | Cancer Mortality | Depopulation | Emigration | Science and diplomacy | SEEIIST,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,30-CE-0838742/00-87,,,,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

20. Instrument",Science Diplomacy in Russia: New Trends and DimensionsThe article concentrates on the new dimensions of science diplomacy (SD) in Russia. The emphasis is on the dynamics of the three main constituents of SD concept. The dynamics is analyzed in the context of SD in Russia. The article considers the main strategic documents providing the regulatory framework for the development of the SD in Russia at present. The examples of good practice of SD in Russia are provided. Special attention is paid to the humanities aspects of SD. We introduce cognitive dimension of SD aimed at the study of cognitive processing of information mechanisms involved in the intercultural dialogue as the main instrument of SD.,yes,yes,Russian Federation,Russian Federation,Russian Federation,None,None,Eastern Europe,,Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe,Eastern Europe,Europe,,Europe,Europe,Europe,{'Eastern Europe'},global_north

Drawing on records from this non-governmental organization, interpolated with Chinese and US government sources, this article argues that the CSCPRC’s failures and successes depended on how effectively they adapted their scholarly initiative to changing US-China diplomatic ties. Scientists were not beholden to politics, however; indeed, they made a critical contribution to the development of Sino-American diplomacy, helping reestablish official relations in 1978.

This article examines efforts by American scientists to rebuild a relationship with their Chinese colleagues and to reintegrate China into global science. It traces how a transnational American organization – the Committee on Scholarly Communication with the PRC (CSCPRC) – initially failed but ultimately succeeded in extending the frontier of their epistemic community by reopening China to American scientists. Drawing on records from this non-governmental organization, interpolated with Chinese and US government sources, this article argues that the CSCPRC’s failures and successes depended on how effectively they adapted their scholarly initiative to changing US-China diplomatic ties. Scientists were not beholden to politics, however; indeed, they made a critical contribution to the development of Sino-American diplomacy, helping reestablish official relations in 1978. This article further reveals the transnational origins of China’s opening to the world and subsequent meteoric economic development, as well as the nexus between science and America’s historic ‘Open Door’ policy.",yes,yes,China; United States of America,United States of America; China,China; United States of America,None;,None; None,Northern America; Eastern Asia,,Northern America; Eastern Asia,Northern America; Eastern Asia,Eastern Asia; Northern America,Americas; Asia,,Americas; Asia,Americas; Asia,Asia; Americas,{'Northern Europe'},global_north

Although the current literature on SD has explored the relation between science and diplomacy, the question of how individual science projects can effectively aid SD has been left largely unanswered. Drawing on the SD as well as on the place and policy branding literature, a framework for the analysis and conceptualization of branding as a tool for SD and for Public Diplomacy in general is developed. This framework introduces three distinct branding styles: nation branding, policy branding and policy tool branding. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated by the comparison of two cases of branding by nation state policy makers: branding in the field of German transnational education and in the science and knowledge-based Dutch Water Diplomacy. The German case study shows that branding activities relating to ‘German’ SD are fragmented and focus mostly on individual projects, while the use of transnational education as an instrument to advance policy branding or nation branding remains largely underdeveloped. Such a lopsided branding process undermines the effectiveness of branding as an effective SD tool. In contrast, the potential of coordinated branding strategies as a foreign policy tool becomes apparent in the ‘Dutch Delta Approach’. In this centralised and coordinated branding process, activities on all three proposed branding layers were implemented, effectively employing branding to increase the visibility of the Dutch nation state, increase the attraction of its high-tech water management sector as well as to rejuvenate the Netherland’s bi-lateral relations with selected partner countries. Branding, as we argue, should be added to the analysis of contemporary science diplomacy as well as of broader foreign policies, adding to the understanding of SD as an instrument of cross-border communication and global opinion shaping.

Global opinion shaping","Emotional policies: Introducing branding as a tool for science diplomacyThis article seeks to expand the science diplomacy (SD) discourse by introducing the concept of branding, focusing on its use as a tool for nation state decision makers. Although the current literature on SD has explored the relation between science and diplomacy, the question of how individual science projects can effectively aid SD has been left largely unanswered. Drawing on the SD as well as on the place and policy branding literature, a framework for the analysis and conceptualization of branding as a tool for SD and for Public Diplomacy in general is developed. This framework introduces three distinct branding styles: nation branding, policy branding and policy tool branding. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated by the comparison of two cases of branding by nation state policy makers: branding in the field of German transnational education and in the science and knowledge-based Dutch Water Diplomacy. The German case study shows that branding activities relating to ‘German’ SD are fragmented and focus mostly on individual projects, while the use of transnational education as an instrument to advance policy branding or nation branding remains largely underdeveloped. Such a lopsided branding process undermines the effectiveness of branding as an effective SD tool. In contrast, the potential of coordinated branding strategies as a foreign policy tool becomes apparent in the ‘Dutch Delta Approach’. In this centralised and coordinated branding process, activities on all three proposed branding layers were implemented, effectively employing branding to increase the visibility of the Dutch nation state, increase the attraction of its high-tech water management sector as well as to rejuvenate the Netherland’s bi-lateral relations with selected partner countries. Branding, as we argue, should be added to the analysis of contemporary science diplomacy as well as of broader foreign policies, adding to the understanding of SD as an instrument of cross-border communication and global opinion shaping.

Transboundary contexts","Hydrodiplomacy and adaptive governance at the U.S.-Mexico border: 75 years of tradition and innovation in transboundary water managementThe United States and Mexico have engaged in hydrodiplomacy—a practice of transboundary water management that blends water diplomacy and science diplomacy–for more than 75 years, since the adoption of the Treaty of 1944 and the creation of the International Boundary and Water Commission. We examine six major turning points in U.S.-Mexico hydrodiplomacy to ascertain the key factors in the region's history of resolving transboundary water issues. We find that recognized adaptive governance indicators—such as social learning, sustained relationships, flexible governance mechanisms, and state and non-state networks are essential elements of hydrodiplomacy. Our research suggests that robust and foundational institutions comprise another key indicator of adaptive governance specifically in transboundary contexts. A commitment to both science and diplomacy have been important components underlying the effectiveness of hydrodiplomacy in the border region. Binational networks involving diverse state and non-state actors at multiple scales have increasingly played a pivotal role in shaping desirable hydrodiplomatic outcomes in the region.",yes,yes,Mexico; United States of America,Mexico; United States of America,Mexico; United States of America,Central America; None,Central America; None ,Latin America and the Caribbean; Northern America,,Latin America and the Caribbean; Northern America,Latin America and the Caribbean; Northern America,Latin America and the Caribbean; Northern America ,Americas,,Americas,Americas,Americas; Americas,"{'Latin America and the Caribbean', 'Northern America'}",collaboration

This study reduces science diplomacy to an effective means for the strategic development of nanotechnology in Africa. African nations are currently not encouragingly close to the leading nations in nanotechnology, yet there seem to be extant diplomatic relationship with many of these forefront nations. African diplomats are state actors in science diplomacy to propose foreign policies that will meet the domestic demand for science and technology development in Africa, especially for emerging technologies like nanotechnology. The necessity of inclusion of competent scientists with diplomatic skills as members of the diplomatic corps is recommended here as one of the ways to develop nanotechnology in Africa. The scientist diplomats will function to foster international scientific collaborations, drive platforms for national research facility development and for non-state actors to thrive in their domestic nano-research. Scientifically informed foreign policies are presented here to have potentials to significantly assist Africa in developing nanotechnology and provide pathways for overcoming the numerous constraints to nanotechnology development in Africa. Critical areas of intervention include human capacity development, national nano-research laboratory facilities, platforms for institutional collaborations, post-graduate student training and robust exchange programs.

Science diplomacy","Engaging science diplomacy for nanotechnology development in AfricaThe concept of science diplomacy is gaining ground as a global strategy in addressing global concerns such as global peace, insecurity, climate change and environmental impact. This study reduces science diplomacy to an effective means for the strategic development of nanotechnology in Africa. African nations are currently not encouragingly close to the leading nations in nanotechnology, yet there seem to be extant diplomatic relationship with many of these forefront nations. African diplomats are state actors in science diplomacy to propose foreign policies that will meet the domestic demand for science and technology development in Africa, especially for emerging technologies like nanotechnology. The necessity of inclusion of competent scientists with diplomatic skills as members of the diplomatic corps is recommended here as one of the ways to develop nanotechnology in Africa. The scientist diplomats will function to foster international scientific collaborations, drive platforms for national research facility development and for non-state actors to thrive in their domestic nano-research. Scientifically informed foreign policies are presented here to have potentials to significantly assist Africa in developing nanotechnology and provide pathways for overcoming the numerous constraints to nanotechnology development in Africa. Critical areas of intervention include human capacity development, national nano-research laboratory facilities, platforms for institutional collaborations, post-graduate student training and robust exchange programs. These machineries also benefit independent individual researchers by leveraging on the international networks created by science attachés through science diplomacy.",yes,yes,Africa,None,None,None,None,,,,None,None,,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa ,{'Sub-Saharan Africa'},global_south

Alekseeva Theory of International Relations as Political Philosophy and Science (Moscow: Aspect Press; 2019). The last decades have been marked by large-scale transformations: the spatial-temporal characteristics of political processes change — political time accelerates, political space shrinks, sequence of the political development stages changes; boundaries between internal and external, center and periphery, material and immaterial blur. Despite the fact that these changes affect both domestic and international policies, the complexity of global political shifts significantly exceeds all internal conflicts. However, understanding of large-scale transformations lags behind the need for their meaningful interpretation.

Alekseeva Theory of International Relations as Political Philosophy and Science (Moscow: Aspect Press; 2019). The last decades have been marked by large-scale transformations: the spatial-temporal characteristics of political processes change — political time accelerates, political space shrinks, sequence of the political development stages changes; boundaries between internal and external, center and periphery, material and immaterial blur. Despite the fact that these changes affect both domestic and international policies, the complexity of global political shifts significantly exceeds all internal conflicts. However, understanding of large-scale transformations lags behind the need for their meaningful interpretation. The need to understand the essence of large-scale processes is an inevitable and serious challenge for the management system. Thus, we need a theory of international research that would become a basis for both understanding the essence of changes and predicting the future development. Based on the achievements of foreign and Russian theory of international relations, T.A. Alekseeva presents a detailed conceptualization of this science. In the book, all its essential components are described in detail and combined into a logically consistent system, which brings the theory of international relations to a new level of the theoretical-methodological conceptualization.

The exhibit was part of a broader approach to U.S. diplomacy in this period, where science and technology, or in this case a scientific specimen, were deployed to spread Western democratic values, win over international public opinion, and counter anti-American sentiment.

The intervention incorporated various elements to promote gender-sensitive technical and cultural literacy through an international outreach and science diplomacy framework, justified by various kind of literature in STEM learning. We recount the experiences of three cohorts of students learning about impacts of climate change at sites in Bolivia, South Africa and Panama.

The results of the study show that, with 5569 joint publications and as part of the 10,239 authors from both countries, Iranian students in Malaysia have contributed to 10.13% of Iran’s international joint publications between 2012 and 2017. Additionally, Iranian students in Malaysia have contributed to 9.8% of all Malaysian international joint publications during the same period. This is equal to 2.06% and 3.6% of all scientific publications in Iran and Malaysia, respectively. Using Malaysia as a specific case, the study shows a significant relationship between the presence of Iranian students in Malaysia and the growth of scientific and academic collaboration between the two countries. The results of the study have many scientific, political, cultural, and social implications. Considering this study and applying its results to similar cases, “Scientific Diplomacy” seems to work successfully worldwide and plays a key role in future relations among nations. “Scientific Diplomacy” has great potential for furthering the development of relations between nations in very intelligent ways, and may help their states avoid possible disputes and conflicts.",Iran | Malaysia | Scientific diplomacy | Smart power | Students,3,0,,,,undefined,,,,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n1.

Due to rapid changes in science and technology, “Science and Technology Diplomacy” (scientific diplomacy) has emerged as a new strategy for developing, shaping, and reshaping international relations across the world. In this paper, a scientometric approach is applied to study the trend and progress of “Scientific Diplomacy” in Iran’s relationship with Malaysia during the last few years. The results of the study show that, with 5569 joint publications and as part of the 10,239 authors from both countries, Iranian students in Malaysia have contributed to 10.13% of Iran’s international joint publications between 2012 and 2017. Additionally, Iranian students in Malaysia have contributed to 9.8% of all Malaysian international joint publications during the same period. This is equal to 2.06% and 3.6% of all scientific publications in Iran and Malaysia, respectively. Using Malaysia as a specific case, the study shows a significant relationship between the presence of Iranian students in Malaysia and the growth of scientific and academic collaboration between the two countries. The results of the study have many scientific, political, cultural, and social implications. Considering this study and applying its results to similar cases, “Scientific Diplomacy” seems to work successfully worldwide and plays a key role in future relations among nations. “Scientific Diplomacy” has great potential for furthering the development of relations between nations in very intelligent ways, and may help their states avoid possible disputes and conflicts.",yes,yes,Malaysia; Iran,Malaysia; Iran,Malaysia; Iran,None; None,None; None,South-eastern Asia; Southern Asia,,South-eastern Asia; Southern Asia,South-eastern Asia; Southern Asia,South-eastern Asia; Southern Asia,Asia,,Asia,Asia,Asia; Asia ,"{'South-eastern Asia', 'Southern Asia'}",global_south

An important question that is currently at the heart of multilateral negotiations on sustainable development. There is no doubt that scientific knowledge and its application have benefited billions across the globe. As the multilateral system seeks to implement the new development platform represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is increasing acceptance of a distinct role for world-class scientific knowledge and technological understanding in diplomacy. In this evolution of the interface of science with politics, the work of the scientist is being increasingly brought into the halls of political power to inform policy formulation at national, regional and international levels with the aim of improving the human condition. However, the architecture and outcomes of the interactions between science and diplomacy are not without challenge, particularly in how they connect with political pragmatism.

An important question that is currently at the heart of multilateral negotiations on sustainable development. There is no doubt that scientific knowledge and its application have benefited billions across the globe. As the multilateral system seeks to implement the new development platform represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is increasing acceptance of a distinct role for world-class scientific knowledge and technological understanding in diplomacy. In this evolution of the interface of science with politics, the work of the scientist is being increasingly brought into the halls of political power to inform policy formulation at national, regional and international levels with the aim of improving the human condition. However, the architecture and outcomes of the interactions between science and diplomacy are not without challenge, particularly in how they connect with political pragmatism. In this article, I aim to draw lessons from two diplomatic contexts in which I have worked. The first, as a Minister and international representative of Barbados, a Small Island Developing State (SIDS); and the second, as Assistant Secretary General of the UN and Executive Coordinator of the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development.",yes,yes,Barbados,Barbados,Barbados,Carribean,Caribbean ,Latin America and the Caribbean,,Latin America and the Caribbean,Latin America and the Caribbean,Latin America and the Caribbean ,Americas,,Americas,Americas,Americas ,{'Northern America'},global_north

The interest in examining the Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RTD&I) structures and policies in this country stems from the particularity of the above research governance structure in combination with the strong international commitment and involvement of its Transport related industries and the private sector. It also stems from the observation that Japan is a relatively speaking “slow mover” when it comes to institutional or cultural change as well as a relatively “closed” system, regarding RTD&I. Its official efforts to embrace new thinking, seem in conflict with a systemic resistance to change and this may create sub-optimal or even contradictory policies and programs that could compromise Japan’s efforts to regain its RTD&I prominence globally and in East Asia. This chapter examines all these issues in a systematic and thorough way starting with an examination of the background to economic change in Japan and the emergence of its Science and Technology Basic Plans . It then proceeds to examine the Japanese research governance and funding system and its main international RTD&I collaboration policies and activities. It also focuses on transport research and examines its place in the overall Japanese RTD&I system, its principal stakeholders, and gives specific examples of current Japanese international RTD&I cooperation efforts in the transport sector. The Chapter concludes that even if Japan is able to establish an optimal RTD&I international cooperation policy, there are a number of factors that will continue to slow its ability to compete on the RTD&I front. These include an aging population that is highly dependent on social services and thus absorbing many public funding resources; the “insular” culture in the country that is biased against significant participation by foreign scientists; the corresponding reluctance of foreign scientists to relocate to Japan; the growing labour costs; and an apparent reluctance to encourage foreign investment for RTD&I in Japan. In the field of transport, Japan (especially the Japanese private sector) is making considerable progress in establishing international transportation RTD&I collaborations with Europe, the United States, and other countries of East Asia. A major sign of this progress is Japan’s so called ST&I diplomacy relationships primarily with other East Asian governments. This maybe driven by competition considerations and the potential for finding new markets but it is still a very significant “opening” of the Japanese RTD&I system to the outside world. The Chapter provides a SWOT analysis to examine and evaluate these initiatives and the numerous opportunities for greater collaboration between Japan and other countries.

The purpose of the Conferences is to provide a forum for the discussion of scientific and educational issues of importance to the region and the world that transcend geopolitical boundaries and international politics, and for the development of collaborations among the participants. The topics that are discussed include air and water quality, renewable energy sources, bio-medicinal chemistry, nanotechnology and material science, chemistry safety and security, and chemistry education at all levels. The Conferences are dedicated to the use of science diplomacy as a bridge toward peace in that troubled and very important region of the world. They feature plenary lectures by the Nobel Laureates, workshops, oral and poster presentations by participants from the Middle East, and ample time for everyone to make personal and professional connections. The result over the past decade has been the establishment of international cooperation in areas of basic and applied research that hold promise for the development of innovative products, processes, and educational resources. Prior to 2011, the Conferences were organized by a committee with representatives from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Royal Society of Chemisry of Great Britain (RSC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and the German Chemical Society (GDCh); since that time, they have been organized by the Malta Conferences Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization incorporated in Washington, DC www.MaltaConferencesFoundation.org/.",,1,0,,,,undefined,,,,,Yes,"generations=[[Generation(text='\n\n- States: Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates\n- Continents: Middle East\n- Regions: None mentioned in the abstract', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]] llm_output={'token_usage': {'total_tokens': 460, 'prompt_tokens': 407, 'completion_tokens': 53}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'} run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('cc6be811-cc07-4568-83d1-4c8ab6477def'))]","generations=[[Generation(text='\n\nYes', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]] llm_output={'token_usage': {'total_tokens': 402, 'prompt_tokens': 400, 'completion_tokens': 2}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'} run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('8375702b-998a-4d07-aa6b-8dc257313529'))]",Yes,"- States: Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates

The Conferences are dedicated to the use of science diplomacy as a bridge toward peace in that troubled and very important region of the world. They feature plenary lectures by the Nobel Laureates, workshops, oral and poster presentations by participants from the Middle East, and ample time for everyone to make personal and professional connections. The result over the past decade has been the establishment of international cooperation in areas of basic and applied research that hold promise for the development of innovative products, processes, and educational resources. Prior to 2011, the Conferences were organized by a committee with representatives from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Royal Society of Chemisry of Great Britain (RSC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and the German Chemical Society (GDCh); since that time, they have been organized by the Malta Conferences Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization incorporated in Washington, DC www.MaltaConferencesFoundation.org/.",yes,yes,"Bahrain; Egypt; Iran; Iraq; Israel; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Libya; Palestine; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; Turkey; United Arab Emirates; United States of America; United Kingdom; Germany, Malta",Egypt; Libya; United States of America; Iran; Bahrain; Iraq; Israel; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Palestine; Syria; Turkey; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; Malta; Germany,Bahrain; Egypt; Iran; Iraq; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Libya; Syria; Turkey; United Arab Emirates; United States of America; United Kingdom; Germany; Malta,None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None,None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; None; Nonel None; None ,Northern Africa; Northern America; Southern Asia; Western Asia; Northern Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe,,Northern Africa; Northern America; Southern Asia; Western Asia; Northern Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe,Northern Africa; Northern America; Southern Asia; Western Asia; Northern Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe,Western Asia; Northern Africa; Southern Asia; Western Asia; Western Asia; Western Asia; Western Asia; Northern Africa; Western Asia; Western Asia; Western Asia; Northern America; Northern Europe; Western Europe; Southern Europe ,Africa; Americas; Asia; Europe,,Africa; Americas; Asia; Europe,Africa; Americas; Asia; Europe,Asia; Africa; Asia; Asia; Asia; Asia; Asia; Africa; Asia; Asia; Asia; Americas; Europe; Europe; Europe,{'Northern America'},global_north

Providing a new area of academic focus that has only gathered momentum in the last few years, this book considers these questions by bringing together a distinguished team of international specialists to look at various facets of how diplomacy and science are influenced by each other. The book not only dissects the ways that politics, science and diplomacy have become intertwined, but also highlights how the world’s seemingly most intractable problems can be tackled with international collaboration and diplomacy that is rooted in science, and driven by technology.

Will this new diplomacy of the 21st century prove to be more effective than past diplomacy for the big issues facing the world, such as climate change, food and water insecurity, diminishing biodiversity, pandemic disease, public health, genomics or environmental collapse, mineral exploitation, health and international scientific endeavours such as those in the space and the Antarctic? Providing a new area of academic focus that has only gathered momentum in the last few years, this book considers these questions by bringing together a distinguished team of international specialists to look at various facets of how diplomacy and science are influenced by each other. The book not only dissects the ways that politics, science and diplomacy have become intertwined, but also highlights how the world’s seemingly most intractable problems can be tackled with international collaboration and diplomacy that is rooted in science, and driven by technology. It, therefore, challenges the conventional wisdom concerning the juxtaposition of science and the world of diplomacy.",yes,yes,Antarctica,Antarctica,Antarctica,None,Antarctica,Antarctica,Antarctica,Antarctica; Antarctica,Antarctica; Antarctica,Antarctica,Antarctica,Antarctica,Antarctica; Antarctica,Antarctica; Antarctica,Antarctica,{'Australia and New Zealand'},global_north

Metadata capture what happens on the backstage of science, on the trajectory from study conception, design, funding, implementation, and analysis to reporting. Definitions of metadata vary, but they can include the context information surrounding the practice of science, or data generated as one uses a technology, including transactional information about the user. As the pursuit of knowledge broadens in the 21st century from traditional ""science of whats"" (data) to include ""science of hows"" (metadata), we analyze the ways in which metadata serve as a catalyst for responsible and open innovation, and by extension, science diplomacy. In 2015, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will formally come to an end. Therefore, we propose that metadata, as an ingredient of responsible innovation, can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the post-2015 agenda. Such responsible innovation, as a collective learning process, has become a key component, for example, of the European Union's 80 billion Euro Horizon 2020 R&D Program from 2014-2020. Looking ahead, OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology, is launching an initiative for a multi-omics metadata checklist that is flexible yet comprehensive, and will enable more complete utilization of single and multi-omics data sets through data harmonization and greater visibility and accessibility. The generation of metadata that shed light on how omics research is carried out, by whom and under what circumstances, will create an ""intervention space"" for integration of science with its socio-technical context. This will go a long way to addressing responsible innovation for a fairer and more transparent society. If we believe in science, then such reflexive qualities and commitments attained by availability of omics metadata are preconditions for a robust and socially attuned science, which can then remain broadly respected, independent, and responsibly innovative.

Linking data publications to responsible innovation and science diplomacyMetadata refer to descriptions about data or as some put it, ""data about data."" Metadata capture what happens on the backstage of science, on the trajectory from study conception, design, funding, implementation, and analysis to reporting. Definitions of metadata vary, but they can include the context information surrounding the practice of science, or data generated as one uses a technology, including transactional information about the user. As the pursuit of knowledge broadens in the 21st century from traditional ""science of whats"" (data) to include ""science of hows"" (metadata), we analyze the ways in which metadata serve as a catalyst for responsible and open innovation, and by extension, science diplomacy. In 2015, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will formally come to an end. Therefore, we propose that metadata, as an ingredient of responsible innovation, can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the post-2015 agenda. Such responsible innovation, as a collective learning process, has become a key component, for example, of the European Union's 80 billion Euro Horizon 2020 R&D Program from 2014-2020. Looking ahead, OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology, is launching an initiative for a multi-omics metadata checklist that is flexible yet comprehensive, and will enable more complete utilization of single and multi-omics data sets through data harmonization and greater visibility and accessibility. The generation of metadata that shed light on how omics research is carried out, by whom and under what circumstances, will create an ""intervention space"" for integration of science with its socio-technical context. This will go a long way to addressing responsible innovation for a fairer and more transparent society. If we believe in science, then such reflexive qualities and commitments attained by availability of omics metadata are preconditions for a robust and socially attuned science, which can then remain broadly respected, independent, and responsibly innovative.

Scientists, engineers, and health professionals frequently communicate and cooperate with one another without regard to national boundaries. This report discusses international science and technology (S&T) diplomacy, instances when American leadership in S&T is used as a diplomatic tool to enhance another country's development and to improve understanding by other nations of U.S. values and ways of doing business. According to the National Research Council, five developmental challenges where S&T could play a role include child health and child survival, safe water, agricultural research to reduce hunger and poverty, micro-economic reform, and mitigation of natural disasters. Title V of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY1979 (P.L. 95-426) provides the current legislative guidance for U.S. international S&T policy. This act states that Department of State (DOS) is the lead federal agency in developing S&T agreements. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282) states that the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is to advise the President on international S&T cooperation policies and the role of S&T considerations in foreign relations. DOS sets the overall policy direction for U.S. international S&T diplomacy, and works with other federal agencies as needed. Within DOS, the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) coordinates international S&T activities. The Science and Technology Advisor to the Secretary of State (STAS) provides S&T advice to the Secretary and the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). OSTP acts as a interagency liaison. A number of federal agencies that both sponsor research and use S&T in developing policy are involved in international S&T policy. A fundamental question is why the United States should invest in international S&T diplomacy instead of domestic research and development (RandD) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (STEM) activities, which are facing budget constraints. If Congress should decide that funding international S&T activities is important, agreeing on a policy goal beyond enhancing the country's development, such as improving U.S. relations with other countries, or enhancing popular opinion of the United States may help set priorities.Policy options identified for Congress by expert committees who have assessed U.S. international S&T diplomacy efforts include ensuring a baseline of science, engineering, and technical (SET) literacy among all appropriate DOS personnel, increasing the presence overseas of personnel with significant SET expertise, and expanding the Department's engagement within global SET networks through exchanges, assistance, and joint research activities addressing key global issues. Other proposed actions include increasing USAID support that builds S&T capacity in developing countries, and orienting other departments and agencies S&T developing country programs to support the development priorities of the host countries. Another proposal would establish a new U.S. government organization, modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) known for its risk-taking and innovation, called the ""Development Applications Research Institute"" (DARI) to develop and apply innovative technologies to development problems.

Design/methodology/approach: Employing an institutional perspective, the paper is based on interviews in China and the USA and reviews of government documents and press reports. Findings: Owing to the impacts of the Cultural Revolution on Chinese S&T, the relationship is highly asymmetrical when it began in the late 1970s. As Chinese capabilities have improved, aided measurably by the relationship with the USA, the two sides are now in a position to cooperate more fully across a wide range of areas of interest to both sides.

This chapter discusses international science and technology (S and T) diplomacy, instances when American leadership in S and T is used as a diplomatic tool to enhance another country’s development and to improve understanding by other nations of U.S. values and ways of doing business. According to the National Research Council, five developmental challenges where S and T could play a role include child health and child survival, safe water, agricultural research to reduce hunger and poverty, micro-economic reform, and mitigation of natural disasters. Title V of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY1979 (P.L. 95-426) provides the current legislative guidance for U.S. international S and T policy. This act states that Department of State (DOS) is the lead federal agency in developing S and T agreements. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282) states that the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is to advise the President on international S and T cooperation policies and the role of S and T considerations in foreign relations. DOS sets the overall policy direction for U.S. international S&T diplomacy, and works with other federal agencies as needed. Within DOS, the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) coordinates international S&T activities. The Science and Technology Advisor to the Secretary of State (STAS) provides S&T advice to the Secretary and the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). OSTP acts as a interagency liaison. A number of federal agencies that both sponsor research and use S&T in developing policy are involved in international S&T policy. A fundamental question is why the United States should invest in international S&T diplomacy instead of domestic research and development (R&D) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (STEM) activities, which are facing budget constraints. If Congress should decide that funding international S&T activities is important, agreeing on a policy goal beyond enhancing the countryes development, such as improving U.S. relations with other countries, or enhancing popular opinion of the United States may help set priorities. Policy options identified for Congress by expert committees who have assessed U.S. international S&T diplomacy efforts include ensuring a baseline of science, engineering, and technical (SET) literacy among all appropriate DOS personnel, increasing the presence overseas of personnel with significant SET expertise, and expanding the Departments engagement within global SET networks through exchanges, assistance, and joint research activities addressing key global issues.
